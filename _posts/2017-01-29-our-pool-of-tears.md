> Always remember that each person you see sits next to his or her own pool of tears. –Ron Johnson

Through our years on this side of eternity, a pool of tears will always appear right next to us – both tears of pain and tears of joy.

Its the natural ebbs and flows of this life we have been called to live that is filled with a flurry of tear-jerking emotions, circumstances, and situations. Some weightier than others.

Though every tear does not have an equal weight, every tear has an equal opportunity. Not to mourn, but to grow.

> If we allow our tears to tell their stories, they can become the means by which our lives are transformed. –Trevor Hudson, author of [Hope for Your Tears](http://a.co/eiBzb2c )

Isn't it the very pool of tears that sits next to us - the same pool that haunts us and torments us - that is the life source of transformation, inspiration, and growth?

*How could we know of courage, if we never knew of fear? How could we know of joy, if we never shed a tear?*

Though we may walk through the [valley of the shadow of death](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2023), we must not camp in it. We must march forth, knowing the Light that awaits us at the end of our darkest tunnels.

Jesus implores us in [John 16:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16:33), *In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.*

*I am with you always, even to the end of the age* ([Matthew 28:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:19-20&version=NIV)).

*Need encouragement and inspiration to Find Joy in a Challenging World? Join me on March 31st at the 23rd annual [Silicon Valley Prayer Breakfast conference](http://www.svpb.net/annual-breakfasts.html) to hear an inspirational set of speakers, including Ron Johnson, Diane Flynn, and Vanessa Russell, at the Hyatt Regency in Santa Clara, California. I promise you'll be uplifted and inspired through their pools of tears.*
