With close to 1,000 people in attendance each year, their audio/video (A/V) requirements are no joke when it comes to putting on a high quality conference.

So if you're ever in the area, come check it out with me!

## My Background

Although I have been a multimedia professional for many years, I have remained mostly in the photography/videography consumer market - [weddings, family portraits, and the likes](http://justintoocreations.com/).

However, since 2015, God has called me into [multimedia service](http://wemassmedia.com/) for the nonprofit and faith communities. Together with my team, we have served [Transforming the Bay with Christ](http://tbc.city/), [Southridge Church](http://www.southridgesanjose.com/), the [Bay Area Anti-Trafficking Coalition](http://www.baatc.org/), and recently, [Venture Innovation's Analog](http://venture.org/).

## What to Buy

After extensive research, I found that the following A/V equipment setup kit will provide the most bang-for-your-buck in durability, capability, versatility, and production quality:

# Overview

## Venue

In our venue setting for the Silicon Valley Prayer Breakfast, there is seating about 75-100 feet back from the front stage, the venue utilizes two projector screens on both sides of the front stage, and the distance from one screen to its corresponding side wall of the venue is roughly 30 feet, whereas the distance from the viewable front (around 15 feet) is roughly 75 feet.

In other words, `30'x75'`.

Of course, there is also the *diagonal viewing distance* that you have to keep in mind - *roughly 5 feet more than the 75' length of the venue*:
