[Everything You Need to Know about Movie Projector Resolutions](http://www.ebay.com/gds/Everything-You-Need-to-Know-about-Movie-Projector-Resolutions-/10000000177629425/g.html)

Native Resolution: The maximum output capability of the projector
Maximum Resolution: Should be called the "source resolution" because it is the maximum input resolution from a laptop, camera, etc. over some cable that the projector will even accept, scale, and then project in its Native Resolution.

Scaling: The projector may scale the input up or down depending on if the input is a higher or lower resolution than the projector's Native Resolution.

The resolution you need for your projector depends on your use case - usually one of these two:

1. Home theater - projecting high definition movies
2. Live event - projecting simple, low definition things like computer screens with powerpoint slides or live video feeds from a camera

At live events, such as a business conference, people usually aren't sitting right next to the projector, and the farther a person sits from the projection, the less they will notice the pixelation of the lower resolutions.

# Checklist

1. Resolution - maximum size
2. Lumens - brightness
3. Connection - input source

# Types of Resolutions

## SVGA: 800x600 or WVGA: 854x480 (widescreen)
useful, especially when it comes to projecting basic images, such as simple graphics and textual presentations. SVGA resolution projectors are not ideal for large screens

## XGA: 1024 x 768 or WSVGA: 1024x576 (widescreen)
Projectors with an XGA resolution do the most justice to high-resolution movies, graphics and images with finer details

This mainstream resolution is perfect for displaying large text such as bible verses or song lyrics.

## SXGA: 1280x1024 or WXGA: 1280x720 (widescreen)
Because SXGA projectors have such a high resolution, using them for straightforward presentations and video viewings can be a bit excessive, especially given the price of the projectors.

## UXGA: 1600 x 1200 or WUXGA: 1920x1080 (widescreen)
Useful for only very large venues

# Lumens of Brightness
Lumens are extremely important due to the fact that projectors with lower Lumens require ambient lighting to be low. In addition, less lumens generally means that the projector will need to be closer to the screen.

The point is that the best level of brightness depends on the amount of ambient light, the size of the image, and even the material in the screen you're using. If you need a versatile projector, then a brighter one would fare better in the average lighting environment.

Perception of brightness is non-linear, which means you need far more than twice as many lumens for a projector to appear twice as bright.

See [projectorpeople.com Lumens Guide](http://www.projectorpeople.com/resources/lumen-guide.asp) for charts of Screen Size vs. Brightness in Lumens.

For business projectors the actual lumen output may be lower when in video mode, due to the lower luminance output from video signals.

Projectors for home theater also offer better video scaling and contrast ratios than business projectors.

## Examples
a candle gives off about 14 lumens, a sunset 400. Most offices that have florescent lighting give off about 400 lumens and lighting on a movie set is about 1,000 lumens. High noon on a sunny day can be as much as 100,000 lumens. Most digital projectors usually rate from about 500 lumens to over 3500 lumens.

|---
| Lumens | Ambient Light Requirement | Projection Range | Notes
|-|-
| Under 1,000 | Very Dark | Short | home theater, small meeting room in low light
| 1,000 - 2,000 | Dim | Short | Classrooms and medium size meeting rooms
| 2,000 - 3,500 | Normal | Short | Large conferences
| 6,000 | Bright | Short | Large, bright auditoriums with over 250 people
|---

## Bulbs
The part of the projector that produces light is the lamp, which has a bulb. There are a variety of bulb types including UHP, UHE, halogen, and metal halide. The bulb is extremely important to the imageâ€™s brightness. It should be noted that the actual amount of light (lumens) that a bulb produces will decline over time. For instance, lamps that are rated for 2,000 hours of use can lose 50% of their brightness by the 1,000 hour mark.

Lamps that are UHP or UHE can retain about 80% of their brightness during their entire lifetime.

# Input Connection Source

Analog inputs can experience jittering pixels caused by poor signal synchronization so digital inputs are preferred. For video sources, the preferred connection choice is HDMI. However, HDMI signals degrade over a relatively short distance so a balanced SDI cable is the preferred routing method for relaying a signal over ~10 feet.

# Projection Technology
Today's projectors are based on one of four imaging technologies: DLP, LCD, LCOS, and laser raster. (Don't confuse laser raster projectors, which actually draw the images using lasers, with projectors that simply use lasers as a light source for another imaging technology, like a DLP or LCOS chip.)

Most inexpensive DLP projectors and some LCOS-based pico projectors, including both data and video projectors, project their primary colors sequentially rather than all at once. This can lead to a rainbow effect, with light areas on screen breaking up into little rainbows for some people when they shift their gaze or something moves on screen. Those who are sensitive to this effect can find it annoying, particularly for long sessions.

LCD projectors don't have this problem, but tend to be bigger and heavier for equivalent projectors. The general consensus is that standard-size LCOS projectors offer the best-quality images, but they tend to be bigger and heavier than DLP or LCD projectors, and far more expensive. There aren't yet many laser raster projectors, so it's hard to make general statements about them. However, the one clear advantage of using a laser is that the image doesn't require focusing.

# Throw Distance
How far does your projector have to sit relative to the projection screen? Normal projector lenses can project an approximately 6-foot-wide image 12 to 15 feet away, short throw lenses can be projected 3 to 6 feet away, ultra-short-throw only requires inches to project, and long-throw lenses can be used for large conference rooms and small auditoriums.

Most projectors are only able to throw a limited range of image sizes from any given throw distance.

## Gain
Screen gain is a technical term that describes how the material of a projection screen affects the apparent brightness of images projected onto it. A projection screen can be made of materials that make images appear brighter or less bright than the images that come from the projector.
