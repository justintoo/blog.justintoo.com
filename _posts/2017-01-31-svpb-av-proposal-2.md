*This article is part of multipart series: [Researching A/V Equipment for the Silicon Valley Prayer Breakfast (SVPB)]({% post_url 2017-01-07-svpb-av %}).*

# Summary

The total cost of the revised proposal is **$18,169.03**, which is +$6,628.89 more than [proposal #1]({% post_url 2017-01-07-svpb-av %}) ($11,540.14) due to the addition of the following estimated cost escalations:

1. 2x extra speakers (+1,305)
2. 4x extra microphones (+2,258)
3. 4x lighting (+3,616)

This takes into account a $3,000 capital contribution from WE.

However, this does not take into account insurance coverage, which is estimated to be $5000-$6000/year ($416-$500/month). Therefore, it is not recommended that SVPB covers the premiums in order to be assigned loss payee.
