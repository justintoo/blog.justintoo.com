<hr/>

The [Optoma EH416](http://www.projectorcentral.com/Optoma-EH416.htm) multimedia projector is a good balance of cost and capability.

<!--more-->

This DLP projector was released in April 2016 and is capable of projecting the most common size of modern input sources, especially videos up to 1080p/24 (1920x1080) video resolutions using a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio.

At 4,200 lumens of brightness with a contrast ratio of 20,000:1, this projector is ideal for medium-sized cozy venues for up to 800 people with a moderate amount of ambient light from light fixtures or windows projecting onto a 180 inch to 270 inch projector screen.

The [BL-FU260C](http://a.co/afFvbT5) light bulbs have a lamp life of 3,000 to 7,000 hours (eco-mode to full power), which is good for an average of over 4,500 presentations at 1 hour each. If you're a church with two weekly services, this equates to 43 years of usage (`4,500 average lamp life / (2 hours of weekly services) / (52 weeks of services per year)`).
