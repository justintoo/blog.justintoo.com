# A Holy Ambition

*What does it take to make a difference for God?*

> For we are Godâ€™s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.

We all know God desires to do extraordinary things through us ordinary people - for His exclusive glory - but how do we realize His [Ephesians 2:10]({% post_url 2016-12-26-ephesians-2-10-our-works %}) design in our lives?

In the words of [Pastor Chip Ingram](http://livingontheedge.org/about-us/about-chip-ingram):

>We are living in a window of opportunity... [and] I want to make a difference in my life until the day I die.

*Now that's a holy ambition!*
