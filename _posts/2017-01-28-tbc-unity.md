{% include toc title="Table of Contents" icon="file-text" %}

Last week's [TBC](http://tbc.city/) Large Gathering conference was a powerhouse of influential leaders and speakers.

The conference included a keynote speech by Compassion International's President and CEO, Jimmy Melado, who presented a mindblowingly relevant, intriguing, and inspirational conversation on his career of studying *movements*.

Also on the guest roster were the likes of Danny Kim, Wayne Mancari, Paul Bains, and Ryan Althaus.

The central theme of the conference was centered on the definition of what it means to be a *Kingdom-minded leader*.

TODO: INSERT video

# Kingdom Mindfulness
During the group interview session, Ryan Althaus made a fine, and essential, distinction about the need to not just be *Kingdom-minded*, but to also have a *Kingdom-mindfulness*.

To me, the difference is being passively Christian versus being pro-actively Christian.

Mindfulness is emotional and spiritual intelligence. It elicits a state of constant thought, awareness, and engagement of what surrounds us and what we're doing and thinking. It's being attentive to needs both small and large, both private and corporate.

Kingdom-mindfulness requires a selflessness that will move us to compassion, action, and unification for the Greater Good and the Master's Plan.

# Our Tribal Banner
We all affiliate ourselves with some culturally-constructed faith denomination, such as Baptist, Evangelical, Pentacostal, or even non-denominational. But the Truth is, we're all under the same tribal banner.

Wayne Mancari used an incredibly effective illustration as he solicted the audience with three interactions:

1. On the count of three, I want everyone to yell out your name.
2. On the count of three, I want everyone to yell out your denomination.
3. On the count of three, I want everyone to yell out your Lord and Savior.

It was such a revelation for us all to walk through this mental exercise together to arrive at the same realization that in spite of our many differences, we can remain unified together under the same, one banner - in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.

# What Is Our Unifying Strategy?

> What got us here won't get us there - we need new ways of thinking and praying and collaborating. â€“Pat Gelsinger, Chairman of TBC and CEO of VMware

Jimmy Melado posed the problem best, "We all agree on 'One Kingdom', but where every partnership breaks down is when you get to the strategy level. It's hard to collaborate beyond the philosophy of unity."

So what can we agree on as a strategy?

Personally, I have always had the deep conviction that our strategy as a church should revolve around people. I'm not talking about people we need to save, but the people that will do the saving.

In Nancy Ortberg's opening speech, she said the most effective way to minister is to plant churches. I believe this, myself, but an important distinction must be made.

# What is the "Church"?
We all claim to know that the Church is *the people* - "we are the church" - so why are we still structuring and organizing our Work around programs rather than around people?

It boggles my mind, firstly, knowing how under-utilized church campuses, facilities, and resources are and the poor stewardship example this sets. Secondly, and more importantly, it perplexes me when I think of how embarrassingly under-utilized God's people are.

Mike Brock explained the telling truth, "If you're an accountant, you work on the offering. If you're a tech guy, you work on the PowerPoint." And when you're really getting spiritual, you go on a local mission trip once a year to the nearby homeless shelter or soup kitchen.

Pat Gelsinger introduced the morning with those same, ole' statistics that have become so cliche and common place amongst us Christians, "Only 4% of people in the San Francisco Bay Area go to church on Sunday mornings. That means 96% of the Bay Area is unchurched."

Personally, I've always had the undying conviction that *the power is in the people*, but it wasn't until my further contemplations after this conference that God finally gave me the juicy, one-liner revelation:

> The reason 96% of the Bay Area is unchurched is because 96% of the Church, the People, and the Potential is untapped.

It's so obvious.

# What got us *here* won't get us *there*

It's so silly, when I think about it, that the great minds and leaders of the Kingdom are spending their precious time during staff meetings and board meetings trying to strategize for new, innovative programs and ministries that might attract 96% of the unchurched to join us 4% at a building on Sunday mornings. *Okay, maybe also a Thursday evening for Bible 101.*

The fact is, most churches are only reaching people and ministering to them 52 times a year. Out of 365 days, that's a paltry 14%. Two times a week is 28%, and three times a week is 43%.

When mass communication and education was not possible or available, a church building might have been needed in the beginnings of time, and even through near-recent historical times, just like the town square was needed to provide a common time, location, and environment for socializing and learning.

But the truth is, we don't need to relegate our Christian activities to Sunday-morning in a multi-million dollar building anymore. There are so many more cost-effective ways to minister and to be ministered to.

# The Numbers Don't Justify the Strategy

If a church pays $5000 a month just for their mortgage (for a million dollar property), that means it costs $1,250 per Sunday service each month.

With a very small staff (one or two pastors) and other monthly expenses, it could easily cost the church $20,000 per month to run its operations. That means a whopping $5,000 per service!

If the average church has 100 members, that means each member has to tithe at least $50 each service to cover the costs of that service.

So it costs $50 for an individual just to meet at a church building every Sunday, not to mention the time, travel, and food expenses.

For a family of 4, this cost escalates to $200 per service plus other expenses - easily $250 per service.

In comparison, a conference event reaching 800 people might pay $5000 for equipment rental and $3000 for renting a venue. $8000 for 800 people means just $10 a head, compared to the $50 it costs for a traditional 100-member congregation. That's 80% more cost effective.

The bottom-line is simple: the ancient model of church structure, programs, and ministries isn't feasible, sustainable, or scalable. Even if a church is able to remain self-sustainable, we need churches that are innovating, not just operating.
