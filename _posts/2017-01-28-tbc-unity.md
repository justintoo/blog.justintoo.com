{% include toc title="Table of Contents" icon="file-text" %}

Last week's [TBC](http://tbc.city/) Large Gathering conference was a powerhouse of influential leaders and speakers.

The conference included a keynote speech by Compassion International's President and CEO, Jimmy Melado, who presented an extremely relevant, intriguing, and inspirational conversation on his career of studying *movements*.

Also on the guest roster were the likes of Danny Kim, Wayne Mancari, Paul Bains, and Ryan Althaus.

The central theme of the conference was centered on the definition of what it means to be a *Kingdom-minded leader*.

TODO: INSERT video

# Kingdom Mindfulness
During the group interview session, Ryan Althaus made a fine, and essential, distinction about the need to not just be *Kingdom-minded*, but to also have a *Kingdom-mindfulness*.

To me, the difference is being passively Christian versus being pro-actively Christian.

Mindfulness is emotional and spiritual intelligence. It elicits a state of constant thought, awareness, and engagement of what surrounds us and what we're doing and thinking. It's being attentive to needs both small and large, both private and corporate.

Kingdom-mindfulness requires a selflessness that will move us to compassion, action, and unification for the Greater Good and the Master's Plan.

# Our Tribal Banner
We all affiliate ourselves with some culturally-constructed faith denomination, such as Baptist, Evangelical, Pentacostal, or even non-denominational. But the Truth is, we're all under the same tribal banner.

Wayne Mancari used an incredibly effective illustration as he solicted the audience with three interactions:

1. On the count of three, I want everyone to yell out your name.
2. On the count of three, I want everyone to yell out your denomination.
3. On the count of three, I want everyone to yell out your Lord and Savior.

It was such a revelation for us all to walk through this mental exercise together to arrive at the same realization that in spite of our many differences, we can remain unified together under the same, one banner - in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.

# What Is Our Unifying Strategy?

> What got us here won't get us there - we need new ways of thinking and praying and collaborating. â€“Pat Gelsinger, Chairman of TBC and CEO of VMware

Jimmy Melado posed the problem best, "We all agree on 'One Kingdom', but where every partnership breaks down is when you get to the strategy level. It's hard to collaborate beyond the philosophy of unity."

So what can we agree on as a strategy?

Personally, I have always had the deep conviction that our strategy as a church should revolve around people. I'm not talking about people we need to save, but the people that will do the saving.

In Nancy Ortberg's opening speech, she said the most effective way to minister is to plant churches. I believe this, myself, but an important distinction must be made.

# What is the "Church"?
We all claim to know that the Church is *the people* - "we are the church" - so why are we still structuring and organizing our Work around programs rather than around people?

It boggles my mind, firstly, knowing how under-utilized church campuses, facilities, and resources are and the poor stewardship example this sets. Secondly, and more importantly, it perplexes me when I think of how embarrassingly under-utilized God's people are.

Mike Brock explained the telling truth, "If you're an accountant, you work on the offering. If you're a tech guy, you work on the PowerPoint." And when you're really getting spiritual, you go on a local mission trip once a year to the nearby homeless shelter or soup kitchen.

Pat Gelsinger introduced the morning with those same, ole' statistics that have become so cliche and common place amongst us Christians, "Only 4% of people in the San Francisco Bay Area go to church on Sunday mornings. That means 96% of the Bay Area is unchurched."

Personally, I've always had the undying conviction that *the power is in the people*, but it wasn't until my further contemplations after this conference that God finally gave me the juicy, one-liner revelation:

> The reason 96% of the Bay Area is unchurched is because 96% of the Church, the People, and the Potential is untapped.

It's so obvious.

# What got us *here* won't get us *there*

It's so silly, when I think about it, that the great minds and leaders of the Kingdom are spending their precious time during staff meetings and board meetings trying to strategize for new, innovative programs and ministries that might attract 96% of the unchurched to join us 4% at a building on Sunday mornings. *Okay, maybe also a Thursday evening for Bible 101.*

The fact is, most churches are only reaching people and ministering to them 52 times a year. Out of 365 days, that's a paltry 14%. Two times a week is 28%, and three times a week is 43%.

When mass communication and education was not possible or available, a church building might have been needed in the beginnings of time, and even through near-recent historical times, just like the town square was needed to provide a common time, location, and environment for socializing and learning.

But the truth is, we don't need to relegate our Christian activities to Sunday-morning in a multi-million dollar building anymore. There are so many more cost-effective ways to minister and to be ministered to.

# The Numbers Don't Justify the Strategy

If a church pays $5000 a month just for their mortgage (for a million dollar property), that means it costs $1,250 per Sunday service each month.

With a very small staff (one or two pastors) and other monthly expenses, it could easily cost the church $20,000 per month to run its operations. That means a whopping $5,000 per service!

If the average church has 100 members, that means each member has to tithe at least $50 each service to cover the costs of that service.

So it costs $50 for an individual just to meet at a church building every Sunday, not to mention the time, travel, and food expenses.

For a family of 4, this cost escalates to $200 per service plus other expenses - easily $250 per service.

In comparison, a conference event reaching 800 people might pay $5000 for equipment rental and $3000 for renting a venue. $8000 for 800 people means just $10 a head, compared to the $50 it costs for a traditional 100-member congregation. That's 80% more cost effective.

The bottom-line is simple: the ancient model of church structure, programs, and ministries isn't feasible, sustainable, or scalable. Even if a church is able to remain self-sustainable, we need churches that are innovating, not just operating.

# Unifying Around a People-Strategy

> Unity begins with U-N-I. -Pastor Paul Bains

1. [WE](http://whatextent.com) have all been called to fulfill One Commandment called The Great Commandment - to love God and to love one another compelled by the Amazing Love, Grace, and Mercy of God.

2. [WE](http://whatextent.com) have all been called for just One Mission and that's called The Great Commission. It's that simple.

3. [WE](http://whatextent.com) believe that we are all here on this side of Eternity to live for a Purpose, with a Purpose, and on Purpose. Salvation is only the starting point of our faith, and we have been saved in order to save others. We are not a social club or country club for saints, but a hospital for sinners and a shelter for the lost and a training ground and launching pad for the found.

4. [WE](http://whatextent.com) have all been called to unity as One Body under the single tribal banner of Jesus Christ, inter-racially, inter-generationally, inter-culturally, and inter-denominationally. WE is greater than me, and unity begins with u-n-i.

5. [WE](http://whatextent.com) are all born with a God-given gift that separates us from the rest. So we each have a non-optional part to play in this One Body with many functions - and with the Spirit residing inside each of us, we are fully equipped with everything we need to reach our full God-given potential using all of our God-given talents and our God-given passions and Holy Ambitions, wherever we are in life or location. It doesn't matter how you may have started, what matters is how you'll end. Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future.

6. [WE](http://whatextent.com) who profess Jesus as Lord and Savior have the Holy Spirit of God residing within us. The veil separating us from God was torn a long time ago so we are no longer solely dependent on the priest of our church to hear from God and to direct our steps. We each have our own ears to hear and a Spirit to lead us, convict us, and correct us. We don't follow any man, we only follow The One, true God - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

7. [WE](http://whatextent.com) do not need to be qualified by any man to do the work of God, for God does not call the qualified, He qualifies the called.

8. [WE](http://whatextent.com), individually and independently of others, are answerable to God at His throne for the promptings, callings, leads, and purposes he sows into our life. He blesses each of us so that we may be a blessing. Let us be fueled by Luke 12:48.

9. [WE](http://whatextent.com) must all give selflessly and sacrificially of our time, our talents, and our treasures to be good stewards of everything God has entrusted to us and placed in our care. We believe we have been set free from the Old Testament tithe of 10% - by the saving grace of Christ, we can now do much more.

10. [WE](http://whatextent.com) are all leaders for the Lord so we must all study to show ourselves approved.

11. [WE](http://whatextent.com) believe works do not justify a man, but we also believe that the justified man works.

12. [WE](http://whatextent.com) are all conquerors because Our Champion conquered all. So we can Run Our Race on the Righteous Path with full confidence in the faith He has given us.
