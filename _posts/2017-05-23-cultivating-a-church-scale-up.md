90% percent of all startups still fail.[^1]

And the reason is *scale*. It’s easy to start a business, but hard to scale one, according to ​David Butler, the ​VP of Innovation at Coca-Cola and author of [Design to Grow: How Coca-Cola Learned to Combine Scale & Agility](http://a.co/3IFsm2h).

But how do we move from a culture of start-up to scale-up, especially in the "startup valley"?

*Especially inside the Church.*

*Why we haven't* and *why we are not* is what I'm considering.

# Scale-up

> Franck Nouyrigat, cofounder of Startup Weekend, introduced the general concept of a scale-up in 2013. He defined a scale-up as “a business in search of its maximum scalability.” He suggested that we need to put as much focus on creating scale-ups as we have in the past around creating startups.[^1]

I agree.

We need multiplied effort, not just multiple efforts.

We have enough raw material to work with in Kingdom terms - God and God's people. One leads while the others follow. It's pretty simple. We have all we need.

With a church already on every other block, what we need is not to multiply (in quantity) what what we're doing, but rather, we need to multiply (in impact) what's already being done. And that can only happen through a synergistic scale-up effort within an inter-connected and inter-dependent ecosystem.

> I think we have only begun to see what can happen when startups and big companies, especially multinationals, mash up to create new types of ventures. I’m not talking about big companies funding or mentoring startups. I mean when both startups and big companies understand what each brings to the table and actually codesign, building new things that couldn’t happen any other way.[^1]

# Scale by Combining vs Scale by Multiplying

Rather than multiplying the number of our startups and letting them live a few paltry years before their statistically inevitable demise, couldn't we instead synergistically combine our startup efforts to leverage each one's strengths and create an organization that can scale?

Why does every idea have to become a full-blown organization?

This strategy is wasteful in terms of board member time and energy, resources, and budgets, and it's spreading our "flocks" thin. We need to be grazing together and thriving together on a sustainable pasture, not spreading out the flock into siloed pastures where we are all merely surviving.

God's call for every Christian is to thrive, not just to make it to *the end* alive.

Isn't it more efficient to have one body with many functions, instead of many body's with the same functions? Each body requires the same fundamental resources, so it's easier to sustain one body than it is ten bodies.

One body is incubating a heart while another body is incubating a brain. And both are hoping to grow the other. How long will that take?

Shouldn't each organ be incubated within the same body in order to cooperatively work together? A brain is complex and a heart is robust, but on their own what use are they? Only in connected collaboration can they scale up to comprise the miracle we know as a human.

# Fundable Pipeline

# Stop Engineering

As an engineer and entrepreneur, I love designing and building.

But at this point in my life and faith, I have to be honest with myself: *Am I just building?*

I think there is a 4-step cycle of action:

1. Thinking
2. Designing
3. Building
4. Doing

And as an engineer and entrepreneur, I think it can be very easy to get stuck in a loop of only the first three actions: thinking, designing, and building.

But never doing.

I have to ask myself, do I find more purpose in *building* things with purpose than I do in *doing* things with purpose?

It's a fine distinction, but one that must be made because if more of us found more purpose in *doing* than in *building*, I believe we would see much more collaborating.

In the Silicon Valley – "startup valley" – so much time and energy is spent on starting new things in search of the next big wave. And I believe this is culturally engrained in many of us, including me. Especially as an engineer and entrepreneur.

Beginning a new startup church, para-church, or non-profit is a no brainer. All you need is enough passion to decide to do so. No real funding, strategy, staff, legal framework, or business model is required to start. And that quickly leads to the end.

The end of an individual's motivation and the end of a God-given vision and mission. And that's a tragedy.

Stop engineering. Start scaling.

See [The Lean Church|https://sigmastrat.wordpress.com/2015/03/29/the-lean-church/]:

Lean Six Sigma is a methodology that relies on a collaborative team effort to improve performance by systematically removing waste. Indeed many aspects of life in general are prone to waste. In Lean Six Sigma, types of waste have been categorised by the acronym DOWNTIME: Defects, Overproduction, Waiting, Non-utilised talent, Transportation, Inventory, Motion, Extra-processing.
