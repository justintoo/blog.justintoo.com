*This article is part of multipart series: [Researching A/V Equipment for the Silicon Valley Prayer Breakfast (SVPB)]({% post_url 2017-01-07-svpb-av %}).*

# Summary

The requirements for our lighting application is the following:

1. Flood lighting for entire stage because there may be multiple people on stage simultaneously.
2. Light coverage for stage roughly 15' to 20' wide.
3. Floor-mounted solution because we can't mount on the ceiling.
4. Position of lights must be unobtrusive - not blocking audience's view of stage and speakers (15' to 50' from stage) - slim form factor.

According to the numbered requirements above, the two scenarios in the next section are covered as follows:

|---
| Requirement # | Coverage Description
|-|-
| 1 | Arri 650 fresnel lights provide flood-to-spot capability (52°/14.5°) up to 50' away
| 2 | *Covered by #1*
| 3 | Impact Steel Roller C-Stand with Braking Wheels is a portable, floor-mounted solution
| 4 | *Covered by #1 and #3*
|---

Capabilities that are out of the budget or not possible:

1. DMX for remote dimming capability with dim board (over $2000/light).
2. Truss of lights can only support around 10' wide, otherwise would require additional ceiling support.

## Scenario 1 - 2 Lights

# Research

Here is one of my in-depth chat transcripts with a B&H lighting specialist:

> Matt C: Hello Justin. My name is Matt C and I will be glad to assist you. Please give me a few moments to begin working on your inquiry.
>
> Matt C: The 26° ETC Source Four Junior Zoom 575W Black Ellipsoidal Spotlight with 3-prong Edison plug combines the energy-saving power of the patented HPL lamp, with a dichroic reflector and optical-quality lenses. Source Four technology provides a clean white beam for unequaled imaging, crisp pattern projection, and a bright, even field.
>
> Matt C: These make for good stage lights.
>
> Me: can you please send me a link?
>

>
> Me: Thanks
>
> Me: How many will I need to evenly light a stage that's about 20-30' wide
>
> Me: And how should I mount these? and where can I mount them? can they stand on a single tripod, or similar? a truss? how far can they be from the stage?
>
> Matt C: You would need about 6 and these are designed to be mounted from the ceiling.
>
> Me: Oh, ceiling mounting is not an option for us, unfortunately :(
>
> Matt C: One moment please.
>
> Me: ok

>
> Matt C: Let me know if you have any questions?
>
> Me: Looks good - how do i mount these?
>
> Me: and how far can they be from the stage?
>
> Matt C: Those have a long range, at least 50 feet. You should mount them on C stands. I'll send a link.

>
> Me: ah okay let me see
>
> Matt C: Can I help you with anything else today?
>
> Me: how can i secure the stands since they will be placed near the guest tables
>
> Matt C: The rolling stands have locking wheels.
>
> Me: Oh okay fantastic
>
> Me: So just one 15 lb sandbag for each?
>
> Matt C: Two would be better.
>
> Me: okay, great

> Me: so the arri light will mount on this c-stand and then I can position these lights 50 ft from the stage as "flood lights" to illuminate everyone on the stage?
>
> Matt C: Yes, that's correct.
>
> Me: If the lights were closer, like 25 ft: would 5 be too many and make it too bright?
>
> Matt C: Please note the bulbs are not included.
>
> Me: can the lights dim?
>
> Me: oh okay, can you please also link me to the correct bulbs?
>

>
> Matt C: The lights go from spot to flood with a manual controller on the back and you can attach them to dimmers.
>
> Me: Okay, we'll want some dimmers too please, can you send me a link to a good one for this purpose/
>
> Matt C: [https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/755346-REG/Impact_D_1000_D1000_1_000W_AC_Dimmer.html/pageID/accessory](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/755346-REG/Impact_D_1000_D1000_1_000W_AC_Dimmer.html/pageID/accessory)
>
> Matt C: A scrim for each light is also a good idea to cut down on intensity.

>
> Me: ah, great thanks
>
> Me: okay, almost done with this kit
>
> Me: for the dimmer, can I control them from a distance?
>
> Me: like from our sound booth which would be at the back of the room
>
> Me: or is that dimmer you linked me to controlled next to the light
>
> Matt C: That dimmer is connected next to each light.

> Me: okay, is there any way to control from a distance? like a different product?
>
> Matt C: You would have to go to a DMX system which is a whole other animal.
>
> Me: oh, i see. i suppose much more expensive?
>
> Me: can you link me to one just for reference please?

> Matt C: One moment please.

>
> Me: Thanks - can this also mount on the rolling c stand?
>
> Matt C: Yes.
>
> Matt C: One moment .
>
> Me: how far can I have this light?
>
> Me: is it possible to light the stage from 75' ?
>
> Matt C: Yes, that would reach 75-100 feet.
>
> Matt C: I have to double check the stands.
>
> Me: oh wow, okay, how many would i need to cover 20' wide across the stage?
>
> Me: (from 75-100 ft')
>
> Matt C: I would still recommend 5.
>
> Me: Okay
>
> Me: so is this model remotely operable? dimming and turning? or is turning the light as a spot following the speaker still manual
>
> Matt C: You can remotely dim it if you connect it to a light board.
>
> Me: Okay, please link me to a light board
>
> Matt C: You cannot remotely dim it.
>
> Matt C: Sorry
>
> Matt C: You can not remotely turn it.
