# Skip's E.I.G.H.T Personal Values

What defines you is what will guide you.

[Skip Vaccarello](http://skipvaccarello.com/) explained this to me very well with this [good-to-great]({% post_url 2017-02-15-the-good-to-great-transformation %}) truth: "Great leaders define their values, live them out, and never change or compromise them."

For Skip, what guides him are his E.I.G.H.T personal values:

1. **E**ncouragement
2. **I**ntegrity
3. **G**race
4. **H**umility
5. **T**hankfulness

(Yes, there are only 5 in the E.I.G.H.T - less is more, right? ;-)

# My C.A.L.I Personal Values

*People committed to doing bold things in both speech and action.*

In the short years of [my work, life, experience, and pursuits](http://justintoo.com), a resounding theme has developed in my life, and I can sum them up in what I'm deeming my four C.A.L.I personal values:

1. **C**ommunity - Doing people- and community-centric things
2. **A**udacity - Doing bold things, boldly
3. **L**oyalty - Being committed to doing things
4. **I**ntegrity - Doing things in both speech and action

The astute reader will notice that all four of my personal values involves *doing*, not just *being*.

![Quote by Justin Too on his CALI personal values](/assets/images/posts/2017/02-february/2017-02-15-personal-values-define-and-guide-you/quote-my-cali-personal-values.jpg){: .align-center}

## **C**ommunity

Community has always been a core value of mine - family, friends, people - and it's what underpins the work, vision, and passion of my [ecclesiastical social enterprise](http://whatextent.com/), which is really just the life God has called me to lead.

And in my work and life, I hold a deep a conviction that community is built by empowering people. As individuals succeed, teams succeed. As people thrive, communities thrive.

I think, as a church, we've convoluted *the strategy* and we need to get back to first principles.

It's all about *people*. And team work makes the dream work.

[Unity begins with U-N-I]({% post_url 2017-01-28-unity-begins-with-u-n-i %}). And community is completed with U-N-I-T-Y.

## **A**udacity

*Freedom lies in being bold.*

I believe that bold pursuits emboldens a person. But not just by *setting* [big, hairy, audacious goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal), but by actually *pursuing* them. It's through the exercising of our faith that our faith and character is fortified.

Christopher Columbus said it best: "You can never cross the ocean until you have the courage to lose sight of the shore."

And Henry Ford couldn't have been more correct: "Whether you think you can, or you think you can't -- you're right."

[WE](http://whatextent.com/) think we can, and WE act like we can, because we know [He](https://youtu.be/_OLezoUvOEQ) can.

## **L**oyalty

## **I**ntegrity

Integrity was best explained to me first and best by [John W. Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Thompson): "Integrity is doing what you say, and saying what you do."

That was a formative conversation for me. I was just a senior in high school at the time, and I can't forget how intensely John told me this looking squarely into my youthful eyes.

Shortly after my [Junior Achievement](https://www.juniorachievement.org) interview with him way back then, he offered me an internship with the company he was leading as CEO at the time, [Symantec](https://www.symantec.com/). Ever since, I've held on dearly to his words.
