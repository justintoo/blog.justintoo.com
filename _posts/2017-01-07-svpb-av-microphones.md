# Summary

We could choose to use all handhelds so nobody has to be mic'd up beforehand, avoiding the needed coordination to ensure it's clipped on to the vocal and then turned on.

# Overview

## [MX150: Subminiature Lavalier Microphone](http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/microflex/mx150-subminiature-lavalier-microphone)

Lavalier microphone for TV broadcasting, lectures, teleconferencing, houses of worship, and live sound.

The XLR version has an in-line preamp - an electronic amplifier that converts a weak electrical signal into an output signal strong enough to be noise tolerant and strong enough for further processing.

## [Shure SM58](http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/sm/sm58-vocal-microphone)

Tuned to accentuate the warmth and clarity of lead and back-up vocals.

> For capturing audio, the QLXD24/SM58 Handheld Wireless Microphone System by Shure is a good choice to get the job done. It can be used for mid-size events and installations in businesses, hotels, government offices, schools, houses of worship, live performance spaces, and more. It features 24-bit digital audio, network control, and AES-256 encryption.

## Shopping Criteria

*[gearank.com: The Best Wireless Microphone System Guide - Handheld](https://www.gearank.com/guides/wireless-microphone-system):*

> 1. **Number of Channels.** This determines the maximum number of compatible systems you can use at the same time. For example if you need to use 20 wireless mics then you'd need 20 channels so you can run 20 systems simultaneously.
>
> 2. **Range.** The ranges presented below are for line of sight where you can see the receiver from where you are using the mic. If you are going to have obstacles, such as walking around a crowd of people as you might in a theater restaurant or house of worship, then it's best to get one with at least twice the range as the actual distance to the receiver. For the kinds of gigs most bands play you won't really need to go beyond 150 feet.
>
> 3. **Receiver Frequency.** If you, or someone else nearby, are using other wireless systems for mics or instruments, then be sure to check which frequencies they use and get a new wireless mic system that runs on a different frequency range. You can find the frequency in your manual or printed on the back of your receiver.
>
> 4. **Analog vs Digital.** Theoretically digital systems should provide slightly less noise at long range and slightly better dynamic and frequency response. The reality is that for most music and worship applications the analog systems are rated higher than their more expensive digital cousins

## Common Mistakes

*[blog.shure.com: Avoid These Five Mistakes in Wireless](http://blog.shure.com/avoid-these-five-mistakes-in-wireless/):*

Understanding the basics of how wireless systems and radio waves function will help you consistently triumph over dropouts, interference and distortion:

> 1. **Signal blockage** - Maintain line-of-sight between the transmitter and receiver antennas as much as possible; don't coil or fold the flexible antenna connecting.
> 2. **Incorrect antenna type or placement** - To ensure good diversity performance, space antennas apart by at least one-quarter of a wavelength (about 5 inches at 600 MHz). The receiver antennas should be angled apart in a wide “V” configuration, which provides better pickup when the transmitter is moving around and being held at different angles.
> 3. **Poorly coordinated frequency set** - Frequencies must avoid local active TV channels (up to one million watts compared to typical microphone sound systems 50 mW (fifty one thousandths of one watt!)) and frequencies must be mutually compatible; “Local” is generally considered to be up to 50 or 60 miles, depending on the coverage area of the particular TV transmitter; use Channels that are all in the same Group
> 4. **Poor battery management** - Despite the fact that transmitter battery life is a top concern with wireless mics, users continue to try and cut operating costs by using inexpensive batteries. Most wireless manufacturers specify alkaline or lithium single-use batteries because their output voltage is very stable over the life of the battery. This is important because most transmitters will exhibit audible distortion or signal dropouts when supplied with low voltage. Rechargeable batteries often seem like the ideal solution, but many rechargeables provide about 20 percent less voltage than a single-use battery — even when they are fully charged. To combat battery problems, carefully compare the transmitter’s voltage requirements with the battery’s output voltage over time to make sure that the battery will last through a full performance.
> 5. **Improper gain set-up** - Setting the proper input gain is one of the most important adjustments on a wireless microphone system. Distortion may occur if the gain is set too high, while poor signal-to-noise may result if the gain is set too low; Its purpose is to set the input sensitivity low enough to prevent input overload or “clipping” but high enough so that the signal level is well above the system noise floor.
