# [What's Emerging in the Future of the Church?]({% post_url 2016-12-15-whats-emerging-in-the-future-of-the-church %})

Just at the right time, God led me to what I think is the right tax & legal organization – [StartChurch.com](http://startchurch.com/).

I've been searching high and low for the right professionals for over a year to help me with my social entrepreneurial endeavors, involving my nonprofit organization [Project What Extent Inc.](http://whatextent.com/) and other visionary missions God has planted within my heart and mind.

Looking at [their website](http://startchurch.com/) was like a dream come true because I finally found more people that speak the same social entrepreneurial language as I do!

Everything StarChurch believes in and all the services they provide are EXACTLY what I need and have been looking for long and hard. It's as though God created this brilliant company just for me! Thank You Lord!

I can't wait to contact them after our Christmas celebrations, to get the ball rolling for God's 2017 mission for my life.

Let's. Start. Church.

*The following is a collection of important excerpts I gathered from the [StartChurch.com website](https://www.startchurch.com) for my future reference:*

# Ecclesiastical Entrepreneurism

> When you survey churches across America, less than 3% of churches earn income outside of tithes, offerings and pledges.  That is and continues to be the traditional method of income generation for churches and ministries, but the time has come to no longer depend on the traditional.  We advocate the concept of ecclesiastical entrepreneurism as a necessary component of church life and its impact on the community.  Just imagine what your ministry would look like today if it had the ability to generate sizable amounts of income outside of tithes and offerings.  That is an opportunity worth seizing.  Life is too short to live satisfied with the traditional, especially when there are "new wineskins" for this time and season.  To start and run a ministry owned business is to break out of the traditional methods used in times past and to begin carving a new way of doing church business.  The days of churches depending solely on giving are over.

> It all begins with empowerment.  Our founder wrote the resource titled “Expansion.” This resource casts the vision for why every church should have a church-owned business that produces extra streams of income.  We then focus on listening to you and follow your direction and vision. After all, it’s your call, your vision and your ministry.  We follow your orders, as you direct, to fill out articles of incorporation, church/ministry minutes to approve action, the stockholder agreement between business and ministry, Tax ID Number, bylaws and more.  Moreover, it comes with our founder’s resource on how to start and manage a church-owned business .  This resources discusses everything one needs to know about the ownership of the shares and how to issue them, how to use them to attract investors and to raise capital for the business, the seven considerations of a business plan, how to dream and much more.

> Here is a quick scenario!  Pastor Tom loves to preach every Sunday using illustrations that involve a multimedia experience, whether music and video, PowerPoint, Bible verses on screen, or sermon notes being distributed.  He is able to do that because his church uses the services of a video/multimedia company.  Every week Pastor Tom gets the invoice for it and it is $0.00.  Why is it FREE?  Well, that is because his church owns 100% of the issued shares of the business.  Wow!  Amazing!  It's a real for profit business that the church owns.  In addition, the business pays the church a quarterly dividend of around $12,000.00.  Those dividends are tax free to the church.

# Protecting Assets with a Holdings Corporation

StartChurch: [Protect Your Ministry - Establish a Holdings Corporation](https://www.startchurch.com/services/holdings-corporation)

> The legislative culture seeks to limit the freedoms religious organizations have, but there are still regulations out there that provide great benefits to these same organizations. One of these benefits can be found in section 501(c)(2) of the IRS Code. This is by far the most important aspect of the Code as it relates to churches and nonprofits protecting their assets.  This section of the Code authorizes the establishment of a holdings corporation with the sole purpose of holding title to property owned by a 501(c)(3) organization such as a church or ministry. In other words, a holdings corporation is a corporation whose sole purpose is to hold and protect a church's or ministry's assets. It should never do business with the outside world and does not receive donations. A church can conduct the work of the ministry without fear of losing any of its assets because they will belong to a separate entity. Imagine the peace of mind one can have by knowing that the church can enjoy the use of its building and other property while keeping it out of the hands of malicious lawsuits!

# [Adding a For Profit Arm](https://www.startchurch.com/services/additional)

> Under Section 502 of the Internal Revenue Code, a ministry can establish a for-profit arm to help earn tax-free income by way of donations and dividends. When done correctly, a for-profit arm can give you options that will empower your church or ministry to grow. Most churches are stretching their faith by believing God for $1,000.00 in the offering just to pay church rent every month. Why not believe God for more? If you want the Lord to entrust you with a million dollars of income, you must place yourself in a position where you have no other choice but to trust HIM for a million dollars. A for-profit, ministry-owned, business is just the way to do it.

Also see [Let Us Set Up a Ministry Owned Business For You!](https://www.startchurch.com/services/for-profit):

> Leading a ministry is a very challenging task. The fact that you have landed on this page is an indicator that the vision in your heart is greater than what the ministry's finances can provide.  StartCHURCH™ has come to understand that part of the process of growing your ministry is the development of a business mindset to finance the gospel.  If there is one area where most churches are weak, it is in keeping up with business responsibilities.  Most church business plans consist of depending solely on tithes and offerings.  The hope of most pastors and leaders rests in the possibility of adding new financially strong members who can boost weekly giving.  Unfortunately, that rarely happens as hoped.  What if the church developed a plan to generate real income through legitimate for profit businesses owned by the church?  What if the church created a plan to save cash over a period of time and invested it into a real income producing business?  What if the profits were enough to pay for excellent facilities for the church, which in turn produced income, too?

# Setting Up A Ministry

## Minister

### **Ordination**

> Many ministers believe that they are only able to plant a church if they have either been ordained or licensed as ministers of the gospel. However, after establishing a church on a solid legal foundation, you can become ordained right through the very church you started. We provide all of the needed paperwork that empowers your ministry to ordain ministers, including the founder.

Also see obtaining a [Custom License and Certificate](https://www.startchurch.com/products/custom-license).

### [Minister's Housing Allowance](https://www.startchurch.com/services/housing-allowance)

>
The best tax savings plan in America!

> The housing allowance is one of the best tax saving benefits that exists for pastors. Our in-house CPA and attorney recommend that pastors in America, set up a housing allowance designation set up by the church. By setting up this program, the minister will be able to save thousands of dollars every year in taxes. If properly implemented, any minister can exclude home expenses from his or her income. These home expenses range from rent, property taxes, and principle and interest, to appliances, repairs, furniture, and much more, so long as those expenses provide the minister with a home. It does not matter whether you own or rent a home, if you are a licensed or ordained minister, you can create a housing allowance program and save big on taxes.

### Self-Employment Tax Exemption

> We offer a large discount if you want to create your housing allowance along with your self-employment tax exemption application (Social Security).


### [Employee or Self-employed?](http://www.7cpatax.com/Web_Advantax/html/advantax/clergy.htm)

For tax purposes, members of the clergy may be treated as either employees (preferred by the IRS) or independent contractors. In either case, with approval from the IRS, clergy may decide to be made exempt from self-employment (Social Security and Medicare) taxes. If an exemption is claimed, no benefits are available to the clergy member under either program in retirement. So unlike other taxpayers who are required to pay Social Security and Medicare, clergy may choose whether or not to participate.

## Community Development Corporation

> Imagine meeting the strongest needs of your community, while growing your influence as a church, all with resources from outside of your ministry.
>
> CDC stands for community development corporation. It is a secondary corporation that can be used to accomplish the ministry dreams and vision that a church cannot otherwise accomplish.
>
> A CDC is not an alternate funding source but a separate corporation, run by church members, to reach the needs of your city through the use of governmental grants.
>
> a CDC that is a separate corporation from the church. This is considered a nonreligious nonprofit. The vision for this corporation initially is not “creating disciples”; it is “meeting the needs of your local community”. The staff of this CDC can be church members able to share the gospel. The overarching goal of this organization is to help people. To this end, the CDC can apply to receive monies that the government has set aside to help such needs. As the CDC renders services to the community, the church does its job to share the goodness of the Lord with those who are being served.
>
> Is there something in your heart that you have not done because you do not have the finances for it or because you are waiting for the church to back it financially? Maybe there is another way. Through creating a CDC, you might be able to reach and bless your community and increase your influence in the city.
>
> The CDC can be the avenue through which you can have great impact on your city, while not draining the funds of the church.
