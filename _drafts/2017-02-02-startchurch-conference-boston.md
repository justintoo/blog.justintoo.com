# Dave Hodge - Host

It's not about theory.

Knowledge that is actionable.

# Trey Lewis

Saved in the Air Force in 2015.

Tax, law, and compliance because we love people and we love Jesus more.

Have the greatest impact possible.

No matter what ministry degree you get, you probably haven't received the necessary training for the role of CEO of a full-blown corporation.

One of the top 5 worst neighbors in the nation near Georgia Tech University -

"Today's not about your canned presentation of the Gospel - nobody cares about your pitch. We need to understand the people's needs."

Understand the cloth which StartChurch was cut from -

[Median size of U.S. churches](http://hirr.hartsem.edu/research/fastfacts/fast_facts.html#sizecong) is 75 people and the average is 180 people (due to larger congregations):

> The National Congregations Study estimated that the smaller churches draw only 11 percent of those who attend worship. Meanwhile, 50 percent of churchgoers attended the largest 10% of congregations (350 regular participants and up).

If church growth is important to you, then compliance should be equally important. You've heard it's character that sustains the anointing. Well, compliance is what sustains your ministry.

# What's Happening in the World of Ministry

Before 1992, there was "Sacred Immunity" so that nobody would mess with churches, but then the American Bar Association hosted a seminar to discuss the best way how to sue churches and pastors.

It is no longer taboo to sue a church.

Over 1,000 churches per month get sued; 40% of lawsuits are initiated by board members.

The IRS is allowed to give you bad advice and not be responsible.

A church in Colorado was ordered to surrender tithes and offerings it received from a couple who filed for bankruptcy.

Not everybody who's going to start with you in ministry is going to end with you in ministry - choose your team wisely.

# The Anti-Terrorism Policy
Cross-check people that are visiting speakers or who you are donating to.

1. Adopt an anti-terrorism policy
2. Must check OFAC list

# Management Suite

Audit - take you step-by-step through an IRS audit

# Strategies to Succeed and Protect

Jesus said that we should be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.


Why do you think the church is getting left in the dust?

We aren't getting left in the dust - the dust is already settled.

We have to embrace the shrewdness of the viper.


Harvard released a study that 55% of churches are embezzling funds. (Can't find source on Google)

# The Ultimate Church Structure

Standard Liability churches have are $1M.

# For-Profit Arm

IRS Section 502 permits a church to have a feeder arm - a for-profit arm - without incurring Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT).

The only outlet you have for Christian service is the nursery changing diapers

An outlet for them to serve in their strength.

CEO's and C-level executives sitting in our pews.

Use a for-profit arm for stress-free preaching so you don't have to be controlled by anybody's money.

90% of tithes goes to administrative fees - and that's not an indictment against the church. It's just what it is.

Only 3% of churches generate revenue out of passing around the offering plate -

Joshua - divide all the land between tribes. Invest the tithes in the pastureland to generate profit. (Numbers 18 and 35.)

Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby

The for-profit arm must comply with the church's doctrinal law.

1. Station #1 - Drop off your toddler
2. Station #2 - Drop off your laundry
3. Station #3 - Choose your healthy meal

Spiritual Indignation
TIME magazine - America's most prosperous church: mormon church generates over $800M revenue a year with for-profit arms. Yes, the Church of America is running the bake sale like it's going out of style.

# CDC

They have 30 years of addictive addiction - what do you think they're going to be doing after you pray for them and they give their life to Jesus?

CDC allows you to go after the federal, state, and corporate money.

# Doing Business As (DBA)
File a "Doing Business As" to experiment and prototype to test the market. Once it kicks off and becomes a bookkeeping nightmare, then you can split it off and incorporate as a separate entity.

# Bylaws, Public Policy & 501(c)(3)

Do not copy and paste (lol).

1% of CPA's understand church books.

When you incorporate, you receive a provisional 501c3.

Every para-church ministry must file a 990.

"Pulled" the wrong FEIN - ministry rather than church.

1023 is your public record - it will either defend you or defeat you.

The Musts of Bylaws:

1. Mutual interest clause
2. Formal membership - sign membership agreement
3. Electronic board meetings
4. President/founder's vision

On your board, you only need one member that has a social security number in the United States.

IRS 508(c) says a church doesn't have to formally apply for 501(c)(3).

1. Branch Ministries, Inc. v. Charles O. Rossotti

# IRS Questions

Submit questions in writing and have StartChurch represent us.

# Dave's Story

You, as the pastor, are the closest that some people would ever come to God.

If they don't know where you are, they won't show up.

It takes real money to do real ministry.

It takes real work to do real ministry.

# $250 Rule for Donations Attached to Goods/Services
Need a receipt within 7 days - e.g. a banquet that costs $50, they donate $2500, then the first $50 is not tax-deductible, and a receipt for $2450 is required within 7 days.

Add language in Contribution Statement - "No goods or services were provided... only religious benefits."

# Software

Must have at least one board meeting per year.

Capital Suite - Grant writing for CDC, etc.

Expansion Suite - Multiple-entity suite; how to move assets and capital back-and-forth

Black-box of church (like an airplane's black box) - to hold ministry corporate records.

# IRS Audits

These they'll check:

1. Your corporate records
2. Your books
3. Your reimbursable policy


Under $60,000, only $99/month bookkeeping service and online Quickbooks for free.

Position yourself in the front lines of the battlefield and there lies your perspective.

# Try's Story

1. The further you are from the front lines, the closer you are to the things of the world.

2. You tell me who your friends are and I'll tell you who you are

Hosea - take your place in the Kingdom

# Ordination of Minister

If you do it wrong: Self-employed (15.3% self-employment tax) and employee of the church.

Cramer v. Commonwealth, 2012 - definition of a minister.

Don't think of this as burdensome legislation, but instead, good organizational health.

Recommend best practices:
* $125 minimum fee
* 250 question test; open book,
* I should have my own test on file to make sure I passed it too

how do you spell Jesus? all the same

assign an expiration date to ordination (24-36 months)

# CDC
The Gospel is the only way to transform a heart.

But not every single thing

Purchase property and sub-lease to ministry.

Structure grant-writer compensation to get paid based on receipt of grant. (Capital Suite shows 400 sources of grants; grant.gov).

Ways to structure to avoid compromising situations:

Example #1: CDC rents property from Church and in the rental agreement, the Church specifies property usage must adhere to Church's bylaws/faith doctrines.

Example #2: CDC hires Church to vet volunteers.

# Holdings Corporation

Every time you transfer assets from the holdings corporation into the church, you are poking a hole in the corporate veil.

# Pastoral Love Offerings

Goodwin v. United States:

> It's okay to be gifted spontaneously where it is not tied to pastoral services rendered.

Direct gifts to pastor is not tax-deductible because the pastor is not the 501(c)(3).

However, at the least, it's not taxable income to the pastor if the gift was spontaneous.

Anytime an offering goes through the church and then to the pastor, it will look like payment for services rendered. So if someone really wants to give, they will have to give and forego the tax-deduction.

# Compensation Suite

## Paying a Guest Speaker

Should not be cash from the offering - just write one check to guest after collecting and counting the offering.

Document... Document... Document...

## W-9

Guest Speaker must fill out a W-9, otherwise we will hold 28% for backup withholdings.

Make sure you verify their information - check their identification to see if it matches up with their W-9.

## 1099-Misc

If the amount you pay to the guest speaker is $600.00 or more.

# What if you are the guest speaker?

Create agreement to be sent by church:

Give W-9 and get the other church to write your love offering to the church so it will show up on your W-2.

# Reimbursements

1. Pastor submits a reimbursement form and attaches the receipt.
2. Signature from treasurer.
3. Signature from person being reimbursed.
4. Bring it back within 60 days.

Must have a written reimbursement policy.

Using church credit card to fill up your private car with gas is embezzlement - you have to use a reimbursement policy that pays by mileage.

Use the nonprofit business rate

The church must own the cell phone - The 2010 Small Business Jobs Act now allows the church to pay for the pastor's and other church officers' and employees' cell phones. Including iPads/tablets.

**Adoption assistance**

**Travel** - Travel over 50 miles and spending the night.

Hotel room is only 50% reimbursable if your spouse also stays in there. You must make a board resolution ahead of time: it's going to further the purpose of the organization for my spouse to be with me => 100% reimbursable.

College tuition: ~$5000/year

# Tithes and Offerings

Donated services and rent are not deductible - they must write a church back to the church.

## Conditional


## Designated
Tithe envelope with suggested gift marking, e.g. "designating this tithe to building fund" - Page 161: use envelope to give church full control of the funds donated - "agreement to relinquish control."

## Restricted
If the money is given for only one specific thing, it's not tax-deductible.

# Donation of property
Property Donation Letter -

# Ministry vs Church?

8-10 speaking engagements a month, might want to incorporate a Pastor XYZ Ministries.

You can use a DBA (Doing Business As) for the Church.

Group 501(c)(3)

Network of churches -

# Emergency Plan

Deal with an active shooter -

1. Create an Emergency Plan
2. Threat Assessment Teams (TAT)
3. Firearms in your church

Best option is to use authorized police officer in your jurisdiction for security so liability shifts from your church to the city.

# Pastor

Congregation is less likely to sue pastor if the pastor has established a relationship with them, rather than just preaching and then rushing off after service.

## Housing Allowance

Section 107 formula for calculating housing allowance allowance to the lesser of:

1. The amount the church designated as housing allowance. (big inflated number) - use up to 100% of pastor's salary as eligible housing allowance according to Section 107...
2. The cost of his home ("shoe box method")
3. The fair rental value of the home - If you can rent a full furnished house for $1000/month, then $500 can cover the furnished assets, utilities, etc. => $1500/month

## Salary
Section 4958:

New York Stock Exchange used to be a nonprofit, and he definitely made beyond $110,000. Commisioner of NFL, at schools, etc.

Commission-based salary based on tithes/offerings must have a cap.

## Sermons
The sermons belong to the church - done on church computer, church time, etc.

## Self-Employment Tax
I conscientously don't want to lean on the government for insurance:

Use Form 4361 - apply and keep benefits; opt out of paying into it, but still receive the benefits.

Go to www.ssa.gov to verify you have 40 credits to qualify for retirement benefits. IRS will pay you for your 2 highest years of salary.

When one "opts out" it does not affect secular employment.

You have two years to opt-out - per new church ordination.

# Questions

1. **How do I run a distributed home church model? childcare? food? church-owned equipment (general liabilities)?** Either each home incorporates and becomes a church in the network of churches, else the church will be liable for all activities on premise, which could be devastating, especially without any policies or oversights, e.g. in a church, you might have a policy that two adults must   accompany a child to the restroom, but in a home, you'll probably never get that.

2. **Legal contracts with indemnification clause so church isn't liable for activities conducted at homes?**

3. **Grant identification and writing software or programs?**

4. **If a church incorporates and receives a provisional 501c3, what happens if the 501c3 is actually not approved?**

(http://grantspace.org/tools/knowledge-base/Nonprofit-Management/Establishment/public-support-test)

23. For-profit: Does C Corporation pay corporate tax and then the dividends are simply tax-free? How about C Corp donations to the church?

24. Who owns the written books?

25. **Intellectual Property and Creative License Agreement** - must be added to the StartChurch program (does not automatically happen).

26. **Can all pastors ordained in your church be provided a Housing allowance?**
