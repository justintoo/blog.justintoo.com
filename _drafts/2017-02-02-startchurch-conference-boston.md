# Dave Hodge - Host

It's not about theory.

Knowledge that is actionable.

# Trey Lewis

Saved in the Air Force in 2015.

Tax, law, and compliance because we love people and we love Jesus more.

Have the greatest impact possible.

No matter what ministry degree you get, you probably haven't received the necessary training for the role of CEO of a full-blown corporation.

One of the top 5 worst neighbors in the nation near Georgia Tech University -

"Today's not about your canned presentation of the Gospel - nobody cares about your pitch. We need to understand the people's needs."

Understand the cloth which StartChurch was cut from -

[Median size of U.S. churches](http://hirr.hartsem.edu/research/fastfacts/fast_facts.html#sizecong) is 75 people and the average is 180 people (due to larger congregations):

> The National Congregations Study estimated that the smaller churches draw only 11 percent of those who attend worship. Meanwhile, 50 percent of churchgoers attended the largest 10% of congregations (350 regular participants and up).

If church growth is important to you, then compliance should be equally important. You've heard it's character that sustains the anointing. Well, compliance is what sustains your ministry.

# What's Happening in the World of Ministry

Before 1992, there was "Sacred Immunity" so that nobody would mess with churches, but then the American Bar Association hosted a seminar to discuss the best way how to sue churches and pastors.

It is no longer taboo to sue a church.

Over 1,000 churches per month get sued; 40% of lawsuits are initiated by board members.

The IRS is allowed to give you bad advice and not be responsible.

A church in Colorado was ordered to surrender tithes and offerings it received from a couple who filed for bankruptcy.

Not everybody who's going to start with you in ministry is going to end with you in ministry - choose your team wisely.

# The Anti-Terrorism Policy
Cross-check people that are visiting speakers or who you are donating to.

1. Adopt an anti-terrorism policy
2. Must check OFAC list

# Management Suite

Audit - take you step-by-step through an IRS audit

# Strategies to Succeed and Protect

Jesus said that we should be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.


Why do you think the church is getting left in the dust?

We aren't getting left in the dust - the dust is already settled.

We have to embrace the shrewdness of the viper.


Harvard released a study that 55% of churches are embezzling funds. (Can't find source on Google)

# The Ultimate Church Structure

Standard Liability churches have are $1M.

# For-Profit Arm

IRS Section 502 permits a church to have a feeder arm - a for-profit arm - without incurring Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT).

The only outlet you have for Christian service is the nursery changing diapers

An outlet for them to serve in their strength.

CEO's and C-level executives sitting in our pews.

Use a for-profit arm for stress-free preaching so you don't have to be controlled by anybody's money.

90% of tithes goes to administrative fees - and that's not an indictment against the church. It's just what it is.

Only 3% of churches generate revenue out of passing around the offering plate -

Joshua - divide all the land between tribes. Invest the tithes in the pastureland to generate profit. (Numbers 18 and 35.)

Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby

The for-profit arm must comply with the church's doctrinal law.

1. Station #1 - Drop off your toddler
2. Station #2 - Drop off your laundry
3. Station #3 - Choose your healthy meal

Spiritual Indignation
TIME magazine - America's most prosperous church: mormon church generates over $800M revenue a year with for-profit arms. Yes, the Church of America is running the bake sale like it's going out of style.

# CDC

They have 30 years of addictive addiction - what do you think they're going to be doing after you pray for them and they give their life to Jesus?

CDC allows you to go after the federal, state, and corporate money.

# Doing Business As (DBA)
File a "Doing Business As" to experiment and prototype to test the market. Once it kicks off and becomes a bookkeeping nightmare, then you can split it off and incorporate as a separate entity.

# Bylaws, Public Policy & 501(c)(3)

Do not copy and paste (lol).

1% of CPA's understand church books.

When you incorporate, you receive a provisional 501c3.

Every para-church ministry must file a 990.

"Pulled" the wrong FEIN - ministry rather than church.

1023 is your public record - it will either defend you or defeat you.

The Musts of Bylaws:

1. Mutual interest clause
2. Formal membership - sign membership agreement
3. Electronic board meetings
4. President/founder's vision

On your board, you only need one member that has a social security number in the United States.

IRS 508(c) says a church doesn't have to formally apply for 501(c)(3).

1. Branch Ministries, Inc. v. Charles O. Rossotti

# IRS Questions

Submit questions in writing and have StartChurch represent us.

# Dave's Story

You, as the pastor, are the closest that some people would ever come to God.

If they don't know where you are, they won't show up.

It takes real money to do real ministry.

It takes real work to do real ministry.

# $250 Rule for Donations Attached to Goods/Services
Need a receipt within 7 days - e.g. a banquet that costs $50, they donate $2500, then the first $50 is not tax-deductible, and a receipt for $2450 is required within 7 days.

Add language in Contribution Statement - "No goods or services were provided... only religious benefits."

# Software

Must have at least one board meeting per year.

Capital Suite - Grant writing for CDC, etc.

Expansion Suite - Multiple-entity suite; how to move assets and capital back-and-forth

Black-box of church (like an airplane's black box) - to hold ministry corporate records.

# IRS Audits

These they'll check:

1. Your corporate records
2. Your books
3. Your reimbursable policy


Under $60,000, only $99/month bookkeeping service and online Quickbooks for free.

Position yourself in the front lines of the battlefield and there lies your perspective.

# Try's Story

1. The further you are from the front lines, the closer you are to the things of the world.

2. You tell me who your friends are and I'll tell you who you are

Hosea - take your place in the Kingdom

# Ordination of Minister

If you do it wrong: Self-employed (15.3% self-employment tax) and employee of the church.

Cramer v. Commonwealth, 2012 - definition of a minister.

Don't think of this as burdensome legislation, but instead, good organizational health.

Recommend best practices:
* $125 minimum fee
* 250 question test; open book,
* I should have my own test on file to make sure I passed it too

how do you spell Jesus? all the same

assign an expiration date to ordination (24-36 months)

# CDC
The Gospel is the only way to transform a heart.

But not every single thing



# Ministry vs Church?

# Questions

1. **How do I run a distributed home church model? childcare? food? church-owned equipment (general liabilities)?** Either each home incorporates and becomes a church in the network of churches, else the church will be liable for all activities on premise, which could be devastating, especially without any policies or oversights, e.g. in a church, you might have a policy that two adults must accompany a child to the restroom, but in a home, you'll probably never get that.

2. **Legal contracts with indemnification clause so church isn't liable for activities conducted at homes?**

3. **Grant identification and writing software or programs?**

4. **If a church incorporates and receives a provisional 501c3, what happens if the 501c3 is actually not approved?**

5. **Should we just use a statement of faith boilerplate template and then have a separate elaborated statement of faith?**

6. **Membership agreement template?**

7. **Nolan Insurance?**

8. **Accountability Board: The people don't have to be pastors?**

9. How much is Kingdom  Steward?

10. Are best practices all included in the software?

11. Corporate Veil - Is it okay to have a website that links to every arm of the social enterprise? lease agreement for logo / trademark?
