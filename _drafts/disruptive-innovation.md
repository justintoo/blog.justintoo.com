For [Clayton] Christensen, disruptive innovations are experiments with a new economic model. They often start with a market that is unnoticed or undesired by established industry. When an innovation is successful, its economic model begins to win over the customers that the industry does care about.

My conversations 10 years apart with a pastor looking for part-time work and a pioneer in the emergent church indicate that one economic model for these ministries depends on a leader who can develop different sources of revenue to support the leaderâ€™s work. This approach puts a lot of stress on the leader. Another model treats such churches as mission outposts, dependent on a larger organization for support. Both models do work, but each has difficulties being replicated and scaled.

Instead of starting communities that require leadership, space and more, what if we focused on the work that needs to be done? The economic model would focus on the mission rather than the creation of yet another congregation that would need to be self-supporting. The efforts that prove to be effective and sustainable over time would be models that others could replicate in places where the work is needed.

Microindustries might be started to create needed products and jobs. A community would likely form that has many of the attributes of a congregation but with a different type of work at the center.

A new way of thinking about how to accomplish our missions.

The work of Family Promise (originally the Interfaith Hospitality Network) (link is external) might provide clues. The network serves homeless families and provides an array of services to assist families in creating the economic stability necessary to live in a home. While in the program, families stay for one week at a time in the educational building of a congregation. Those congregations provide hosts for meals and family activities each evening. The network owns the beds and volunteers move them from church to church each week. The network maintains a day-house with laundry facilities and other services.

Congregations and individuals donate funds, but also use of facilities, food and time. Host congregations house the families once a quarter. In this model the congregation is not really a donor as much as it is a partner. Family Promise could not do its job without the host congregations or a dramatic infusion of cash.

Perhaps new economic models will emerge as congregations join forces with others to address injustice. Such partnerships disrupt the mindset that only professionals can help and the assumptions about how congregations utilize their buildings. They might create conditions for friendship in the place of a handout.
