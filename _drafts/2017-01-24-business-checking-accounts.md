# Account Types
There are a variety of business checking account types offered by the different financial institutions out there.

To choose an appropriate account type for your purpose, you'll want to consider the following criteria:

1. Type of business: sole proprietor, nonprofit, llc, corporation, etc.
2. Transaction limits: checks paid, teller deposits, ATM deposits, ACH transfers, etc.
3. Cash deposit limits: cash handling fee on deposits beyond a certain threshold

Credit Unions usually fare well when it comes to limits and fees, but the downside is the typically limited locations of credit unions.
