Although my focus for the evening was to film the event with the [WE Mass Media](http://wemassmedia.com) team, I was personally very intrigued by the notion of the "Future of the Church" that Steven Siwek would be presenting.

I was thrilled for the opportunity to glean some wisdom and have some of my own questions answered by Steven's journey around the country as he interviewed 80 pastors and church leaders seeking to find the perfect formula for the future of the Church.

Here's an excerpt from his story on the website [futurechurch.com](https://www.futurechurch.com/):

> The original intent [of the documentary] was to give the Church strategies and/or solutions that went above and beyond the four basic answers/tenants Christians know: JESUS, Bible, Prayer, Church Attendance. I truly believed there had to be something more. So at first, my questions steered clear from theological debates, and instead tried to be as strategic and practical as possible. As our journey unfolded over the next few years Jerrod and I would end up traveling around the country and interview 80 pastors/Church leaders seeking to find the perfect formula for the future of the Church.

In the end of Steven's long, twisting, and turning journey, his conclusion was very simple â€“â€“ *Jesus*.

# Bridging the Gaping Gap

But Steven's conclusion was just too simplistic and obvious to me - surely there has got to be *more*. Not more to Christ - because He is the same yesterday, today, and forever - but there must be more to *Christ in us* and *us in Christ*.

There has to be a wider foundation to lay - groundwork that's currently missing - that could bridge the gaping gap which I have been suspended between for the past two years through my own life, faith, and nonprofit journeys.

I suspect many others are in the same situation - particularly, my fellow Millennials.
