# [What's Emerging in the Future of the Church?]({% post_url 2016-12-15-whats-emerging-in-the-future-of-the-church %})

I'm currently looking for a framework to help me think about how we can unify the work of the Church in a landscape filled with inescapable diversity - be it cultural, traditional, denominational, generational, or theological.

# The Lost Practice of Cooperation

As Jim Richards said, "Cooperation is almost a lost practice... [But] there are no Lone Ranger Christians or churches. Whether you call it networking or teamwork, we are stronger together."

The future of the church must be an ecosystem rooted in working partnerships and amicable fellowships.

Yet it's far too common and convenient for you and I to sit under the shade of our own church tree, sipping spiritual koolaid, unwilling to cross the heated divide separating our congregation from the congregation down the street from us.

# The Spiritual Divide

In spirit we are so united, yet in the flesh we are so divided.

We allow the power of the Gospel to miraculously heal us, restore us, strengthen us, and fill us with joy, passion, mission, purpose, and eternal hope. Yet we do not allow the Gospel to bind us together as One Church under God. Why is this?

I think it may just be a lack of awareness. We have to first understand that there are naturally different levels of integration and cooperation, as well as structural and behavioral norms to navigate.

Yet though I believe it is imperative for the Church to cooperate, that doesn't mean it can be, will be, or should be easy.

On the flip-side, just because it's not easy doesn't mean it couldn't, wouldn't, or shouldn't happen.

With all of that said, let's take a first look into how we might divide up the work of cooperation.

# Four Levels of Christian Cooperation

In [Four Levels of Christian Cooperation](http://theologicalmatters.com/2014/06/03/four-levels-of-christian-cooperation/) by Jim Richards on [TheologicalMatters.com](http://theologicalmatters.com/), Jim presents four levels of cooperation among Christians and churches from his experience:

1. **Individual Cooperation** between believers using a common foundation, e.g. agreement on salvation.
2. **Congregational Cooperation** within a single church using a set of shared beliefs and behaviors amongst its members.
3. **Ecclesiastical Cooperation** between churches using a formal statement of faith (a "confessional statement") to bind them together.
4. **Moral Cooperation** between churches, individual believers, and the wider community using points of cultural engagement.

Having separated the work of cooperation into four categories, our next job will be to figure out how to empower within each level while synergizing between levels (synchronizing, coordinating, and integrating).
