title: "WE Church - Statement of Faith"
---

On my flight to the StartChurch conference in Boston on February 2, 2017, God provided me with the beginnings of the Statement of Faith for my [WE Church](http:/we.church) church plant. Here's the 12 WE Statements of Faith:

1. [WE](http://whatextent.com) have all been called to fulfill One Commandment called The Great Commandment - to love God and to love one another compelled by the Amazing Love, Grace, and Mercy of God.

2. [WE](http://whatextent.com) have all been called for just One Mission and that's called The Great Commission. It's that simple.

3. [WE](http://whatextent.com) believe that we are all here on this side of Eternity to live for a Purpose, with a Purpose, and on Purpose. Salvation is only the starting point of our faith, and we have been saved in order to save others. We are not a social club or country club for saints, but a hospital for sinners and a shelter for the lost and a training ground and launching pad for the found.

4. [WE](http://whatextent.com) have all been called to unity as One Body under the single tribal banner of Jesus Christ, inter-racially, inter-generationally, inter-culturally, and inter-denominationally. WE is greater than me, and unity begins with u-n-i.

5. [WE](http://whatextent.com) are all born with a God-given gift that separates us from the rest. So we each have a non-optional part to play in this One Body with many functions - and with the Spirit residing inside each of us, we are fully equipped with everything we need to reach our full God-given potential using all of our God-given talents and our God-given passions and Holy Ambitions, wherever we are in life or location. It doesn't matter how you may have started, what matters is how you'll end. Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future.

6. [WE](http://whatextent.com) who profess Jesus as Lord and Savior have the Holy Spirit of God residing within us. The veil separating us from God was torn a long time ago so we are no longer solely dependent on the priest of our church to hear from God and to direct our steps. We each have our own ears to hear and a Spirit to lead us, convict us, and correct us. We don't follow any man, we only follow The One, true God - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

7. [WE](http://whatextent.com) do not need to be qualified by any man to do the work of God, for God does not call the qualified, He qualifies the called.

8. [WE](http://whatextent.com), individually and independently of others, are answerable to God at His throne for the promptings, callings, leads, and purposes he sows into our life. He blesses each of us so that we may be a blessing. Let us be fueled by Luke 12:48.

9. [WE](http://whatextent.com) must all give selflessly and sacrificially of our time, our talents, and our treasures to be good stewards of everything God has entrusted to us and placed in our care. We believe we have been set free from the Old Testament tithe of 10% - by the saving grace of Christ, we can now do much more.

10. [WE](http://whatextent.com) are all leaders for the Lord so we must all study to show ourselves approved.

11. [WE](http://whatextent.com) believe works do not justify a man, but we also believe that the justified man works.

12. [WE](http://whatextent.com) are all conquerors because Our Champion conquered all. So we can Run Our Race on the Righteous Path with full confidence in the faith He has given us.
