WE offer an alternative to the program church model that is focused on the projects and passions of God's people.

Reggie McNeal the Missional Leadership Specialist for Leadership Network

Old colonial mindset, ride out from Camelot and deliver the goods and then be back in the citadel for the weekend services. Doing things for the community vs doing things with the community.

Are we a church in the city or for the city?

If we're a church for the city, then we need to do what we're doing with the city.

Program approach to missional - going out on a weekend once a year to help the community.

We are the people of God partnering with Him in his redemptive work.


# Measures of Success

How much of our facility is being used by the community every week?

## Our Goal

> Our programs work with entrepreneurial innovators – leaders starting and doing new things. We focus on the practical parts of ministry action. We use what we call a “peer protocol” which means that our approach is to put leaders with leaders and let them learn from one another.

## Our Strategy

> 1. Exploring conversations
> 2. Establishing Connections
> 3. Empowering Collaboration
> 4. Encouraging Multiplication

1. Meaningful conversations that lead to action can change the world.
2. Being curious about future possibilities.
3. We are not satisfied with good ideas but seeing the implementation and measuring the results of what is being accomplished
4. We help the CHURCH be the hands and feet of Jesus in their communities and around the world.
