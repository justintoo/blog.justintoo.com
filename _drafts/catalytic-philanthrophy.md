But there is not a mechanism for collaboration among these nonprofits, and there are market forces working against collaboration. The whole approach to fundraising now discourages collaboration. To get funding each nonprofit has to say, “My approach is better than someone else’s approach.”

The difference between thinking about giving away money and thinking about solving social problems has become more and more powerful to me.

# Actionable Knowledge
The last piece is that they create actionable knowledge. They’ve got a target audience, they’ve got a clear sense of what they want the audience to do, and they use knowledge about the problem to motivate people to action.

One example is Jeff Skoll [first president of eBay Inc. and founder of the Skoll Foundation] producing the film “An Inconvenient Truth.” He got information to the public that’s highly effective.

# Creating a Collaboration Infrastructure
People have been talking about collaboration in the nonprofit sector for decades. I think the difference is creating the infrastructure.

Everybody’s busy with their own projects and their own priorities. Unless there’s an infrastructure that holds the collaboration together, it’s not possible for it to succeed or to survive.

But it doesn’t take a lot of money to support the infrastructure. Strive leverages a small amount of money to coordinate lots of people. The culture project has staff and a help desk to make sure the evaluation system works.

You need the infrastructure if you’re going to help organizations. I can imagine faith-based organizations in a city being able to provide an infrastructure. They can be a nucleus for these kinds of collaborations.
