Spread the debt around: While your existing debt may all be on one card to take advantage of a low interest rate or great rewards, it is still worth considering spreading the debt across several cards.

It is always a better idea to pay down high card balances than it is to spread them out over more credit cards, if the goal is a better FICO score

The Relationship Between Your Credit Score and Credit Card Utilization Rate, https://www.creditkarma.com/article/CreditCardUtilizationAndScore
Credit card utilization is one of the most important factors credit scoring models use to calculate your credit score. You can figure out your utilization rate by dividing your total credit card balances by your total credit card limits.

Lenders don't like high utilization rates because it tends to indicate there's a higher chance of you not being able to repay your debts. Keeping your credit card utilization low, preferably under 30%, is a good goal to aim for. Our data suggests an even better goal is to use your credit some, but keep the utilization rate under 20%. Creditors want to see proof that you can manage credit wisely--something you can't do without using the credit you're granted.

How Long Will a High Credit Utilization Ratio Hurt My Score?, https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/how-long-high-credit-utilization-ratio-hurt-credit-score/
It’s important to keep your credit utilization ratio below 30% — both on individual cards and across all of your cards — because it heavily influences the portion of your credit score determined by amounts owed. In the FICO scoring model (which is widely used in the U.S.) and its competitor, VantageScore, this accounts for about one-third of your overall score. Consequently, carrying a high balance on your cards at any point during the month has the potential to damage your credit.

After paying on time, nothing influences your score more than how much of your available credit you are using. Late payments can haunt you for a very long time. However, once you’ve paid a high balance off, it won’t affect your score after your credit report updates and the new data is used to calculate your credit score.

How credit scores are calculated.

Every month, the balance on your credit cards is reported to each of the three major credit bureaus by your issuers. This data then lands on your credit reports. When a new credit card balance report comes in, it replaces the information from the previous month.

This is how the changing information on your credit report can cause swift changes to your credit score. Let’s say you have a credit card with a credit limit of $5,000. In one month you use your credit card to charge a new washer and dryer ($1,200), and then your car breaks down ($800). If you charged nothing else on that card, you have a credit utilization of 40%. That’s a good bit more than experts recommend. But let’s also say you have an emergency fund, and you pay those bills off at the end of the month, and use your card normally the next month, charging about $500. Now your credit utilization is well within the recommended range.

Scores are calculated only on an as-requested basis. Let’s say your card issuer reported after you made the big charges but before you paid them off. You could see a big drop in your score. But if your score was calculated after the big bills were paid off, you’d likely see it jump back up to its previous level.

So a high credit utilization ratio one month doesn’t necessarily spell disaster for your score in the long run.

Tips for taming your credit utilization ratio

Although carrying a high balance on a credit card for a short period of time doesn’t do long-term damage to your score, it’s still important to remember that keeping your credit utilization ratio low is important.

Here are a few tips for keeping your credit utilization ratio under control:

    Check your credit card balances regularly. If any start to creep above the 30% threshold, make a payment. (You can set up alerts to let you know when this happens.)
    Spread your spending among several cards to keep the utilization low on each.
    Think twice about signing up for retail credit cards. Since they typically have very low credit limits, just one shopping spree could really push up your utilization.
