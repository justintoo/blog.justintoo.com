# Investment Opportunities

> Holding companies can invest in anything that an individual can, so you are not limited in your investment strategy. They can own real estate, securities, private investments, life insurance policies, etc. In addition, in most cases the annual investment income earned inside the holding company will be subject to a similar tax rate as you would pay personally so there is no significant disincentive to earning investment income inside a corporation.

# Creditor Protection

> Even in the case where the operating company shares may be owned by one shareholder or family unit, it may still be advisable to use a holding company, as opposed to the operating company, to accumulate and reinvest the excess earnings. One of the significant advantages in this case is creditor protection. By having the excess earnings from the operating company paid up as a tax-free inter-corporate dividend [but is taxed corporate rate in operating company?] and reinvested in the holding company, these assets are out of the reach of potential creditors and liability claims arising within the operating company.

# Tax Deferral and Income Splitting Opportunities

> Profits from an active business earned inside an operating company are subject to a low corporate tax rate. These after corporate tax earnings can then be distributed to the shareholders in the form of dividends. If the dividends are received by an individual shareholder they are subject immediately to personal income taxes, albeit at a preferential rate (i.e. reduced by the corporate income tax already paid).
>
> If, instead, the dividends are received by a holding company, and assuming certain tests are met (i.e. the holding company owns more than 10% of the voting and value shares of the operating company), the dividends will flow tax-free between the operating company and the holding company allowing the entire amount of the dividend to be reinvested on a pre-personal tax basis. In most cases, this will result in an additional 20% to 30% of capital available for reinvestment within the holding company, with the personal tax liability deferred until the funds are actually needed for personal use - possibly as far off as during retirement. The timing of the withdrawal of the funds from the holding company, again in the form of dividends, can be controlled by the individual shareholder and taken out years into the future on a gradual basis to benefit from both the tax deferral and potential tax savings if they (or other family member/shareholders) are in a lower tax bracket at that time.

# Purification and the $750,000 Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption

> Having the excess cash and investments in the holding company as opposed to the operating company, will also keep the operating company “purified” such that at least 90% of its assets are used in an active business and its shares may therefore qualify for the $750,000 lifetime capital gains exemption. Since the capital gains exemption is only available to individuals and not holding companies, proper structuring of the shareholdings of the operating company is essential to allow for this ongoing purification on a tax-deferred basis using the holding company, while still providing the individual shareholders potential access to the capital gains exemption on a sale of the operating company shares. In many cases, family trusts may be utilized in the corporate structure to facilitate this.

# Making the Business More Saleable

> Keeping excess cash and investments out of the operating company is beneficial on a number of fronts as mentioned above, and in many cases it may also be advantageous to hold the real estate used in the business in a separate holding company. Aside from the creditor protection this provides from the operating company’s activities, it may also make the shares of the operating company more saleable where the potential purchasers are only interested in acquiring the true business assets and are fine with leasing the premises. This limits the capital required to purchase the business, which is often significant when selling to key employees or family members who may have limited borrowing capacity. Oftentimes, the buyers will secure the operating company shares and lease the premises with an option to purchase after say, five years, once they are in a better financial position. If the buyer does want the operating company and the real estate initially, that is easy to facilitate and often takes the form of a share purchase of the operating company and an asset purchase of the real estate.
>
> It should be noted that moving excess cash, investments and real estate out of an operating company just prior to the sale of its shares can be done, however when done in contemplation of the sale of the shares of the operating company complicated tax rules will likely result in some or all of this “purification” occurring on a taxable basis.
