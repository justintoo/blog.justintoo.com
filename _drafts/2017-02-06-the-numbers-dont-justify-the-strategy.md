# The Numbers Don't Justify the Strategy

If a church pays $5000 a month just for their mortgage (for a million dollar property), that means it costs $1,250 per Sunday service each month.

With a very small staff (one or two pastors) and other monthly expenses, it could easily cost the church $20,000 per month to run its operations. That means a whopping $5,000 per service!

If the average church has 100 members, that means each member has to tithe at least $50 each service to cover the costs of that service.

So it costs $50 for an individual just to meet at a church building every Sunday, not to mention the time, travel, and food expenses.

For a family of 4, this cost escalates to $200 per service plus other expenses - easily $250 per service.

In comparison, a conference event reaching 800 people might pay $5000 for equipment rental and $3000 for renting a venue. $8000 for 800 people means just $10 a head, compared to the $50 it costs for a traditional 100-member congregation. That's 80% more cost effective.

The bottom-line is simple: the ancient model of church structure, programs, and ministries isn't feasible, sustainable, or scalable to reach the 96%.

Even if some churches are able to remain self-sustainable or manage to scrape by week-by-week, we need churches that are innovating, not just operating.

We need a new model to spread our age-old Truths.
