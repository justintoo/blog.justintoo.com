startuplawyer.com: [Par Value for a Startup Company’s Stock](http://startuplawyer.com/incorporation/par-value-for-a-startup-companys-stock):

> Par value is the minimum price that a corporation can issue its shares.  In the US, par value was created during the time of the great depression in order to ensure a shares could not be sold under a certain price.  Today, that concept is somewhat archaic, but it still plays an important role and should be thoughtfully considered when forming a startup company by filing the certificate of incorporation.
>
> While I typically see either $1 or “no par value” common stock when looking at new client startups that have incorporated on their own or via an online service, I typically recommend that a startup corporation’s Common Stock par value be set at $0.00001 and no higher than $0.0001 per share.
>
> My recommendation is based on my belief that startups should authorize 10,000,000 shares of common stock upon filing the its charter.
>
> The startup will then typically issue about 6,000,000 to 8,000,000 shares to its initial set of founders (as there is a reserve usually kept for initial/short term issuances to people like employees, consultants and advisors).
>
> if your startup issued 7,000,000 shares of such common stock with a par value of $0.00001 to the initial founders, the minimum the founders would have to collectively pay would be $70.  Whatever the setup, usually founders are not paying much out of pocket when it comes to purchasing their initial shares.
>
> It’s also very important to set par value low when you authorize many shares in Delaware because this will help keep your franchise taxes low.  There can be drastic consequences, at least Delaware franchise tax bill wise, if you set your par value high and your authorized shares high.

[VentureVest Capital: Understanding Shares](http://venturevest.com/corporatestructure/understandingshares.html):

In filing corporation papers with the Secretary of State of any state, it important to make the decision whether preferred stock should be authorized. Remember that even though preferred shares are authorized, they may never be issued, and, if issued, the board of directors can set any and all preferences.

startuplawyer.com: [Dual Class Common Stock Structure for Founders](http://startuplawyer.com/incorporation/dual-class-common-stock-structure-for-founders):

> The short answer: [authorize] 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock
>
> Of course, you could obtain the same result by authorizing 1,000,000 shares with an option pool of 100,000 and a 900,000 common stock issuance to the founders. But for some reason, people (and when I say people I mean the developers/consultants/directors getting the stock options) like to have a larger number of stock options even if the percentage of the company would be the same. I guess 50,000 stock options sounds better than 5,000 when you are up in the club.  And vanity does play a part…sometimes.
>
> In general, I wouldn’t recommend as a default that startups implement the dual class common stock structure.  If you have leverage, you’ll be able to install it at a later date.

startuplawyer.com: [How Many Shares Should be Issued to Founders at Incorporation?](http://startuplawyer.com/incorporation/how-many-shares-should-be-issued-to-founders-at-incorporation):

> If the startup plans to bring on additional founders in the very near future, or for some reason wants a large option pool, then that initial number should be closer to 50% than 80%.
>
> While your startup can always authorize additional common stock (upon appropriate board and stockholder consent), keeping a good-sized reserve of unissued, but authorized shares means that you will not have to incur the transaction costs associated with increasing the authorized shares. In order to increase the authorized shares, your startup will have to file a certificate of amendment with the secretary of state which has filing fees associated with it.

> The key is to leave enough room that you can do additional things like authorize an option pool without having to go back to Delaware and increase the authorized common. Don’t worry about the preferred shares yet because you will just authorize the preferred and then increase the common at the round of financing. Thus, 20-80% could be right depending on how much additional common you plan to issue (prior to a financing). The key is to leave ample wiggle room.

> **Authorized Shares**: Authorized Shares is the maximum amount of shares of stock a startup can issue. The number and type of authorized shares is set forth in the startup's charter. The amount and type of authorized shares can be changed by the startup, provided the startup obtains the requisite approval of the startup's shareholders.

> **Option Pool**: An option pool is an amount of a startup’s common stock reserved for future issuances to employees, directors, advisors, and consultants.

Quora: [How many shares should I issue when incorporating?](https://www.quora.com/How-many-shares-should-I-issue-when-incorporating):

> What exactly is an adequate number of shares is usually indeterminable for a startup; however, to avoid future legal costs and possible tax consequences associated with the need to increase authorized shares, it’s best to start out with more than you think you’ll need. Any number is arbitrary, but 10,000,000 shares has proven to be a reliable figure for many startups.
