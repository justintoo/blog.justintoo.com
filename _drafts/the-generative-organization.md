# Generative Organization

The purpose of institutions is to generate creativity by organizing human efforts to a common end.

The generative organization of people’s work, then, is not about creating bureaucracy but about creating the networks, systems, principles and practices that allow for human and institutional flourishing.

# David Toole: What are institutions for?

Peter Drucker once defined an institution as “an instrument for the organization of human efforts to a common end.”

The lesson is simple: human accomplishment depends upon the ways in which human beings organize themselves and their efforts toward a common end; conversely, human failure on any significant scale is often the result of poor or misdirected organization.

Innovation = Institution
Not apparent in Drucker’s definition is that institutions are defined not only by their ends but also by their beginnings, but this is evident in the term “institution” itself. The Latin root means “to set up, begin, arrange, order.”

As one online dictionary (if not the OED) has it, “institution (link is external)” in this sense refers to “the act of starting something for the first time; introducing something new.” Indeed, this dictionary lists “innovation” as a synonym for “institution,” challenging our tendency to equate “institution” with those things already well-established.

Certainly, when we point to the Last Supper and speak of the words of institution, we are using the term in this sense of innovation. At that table in Jerusalem on the night that his ministry took its decisive turn toward the cross, Jesus was starting something new, and two decades later, so was Paul. Before the church was an institution, it was an innovation.

It is not enough, then, to say that institutions are for organizing human efforts to a common end. We must add that they are for the generative organization of human efforts, else we have done little more than define a bureaucracy.

Ants have colonies and bees have hives. Human beings have institutions.

Considered in this light, institutions at their best are the definitive expression of what it means to be human. Their purpose is not simply to organize our efforts or to aim us at an end but, through both, to generate our creativity -- and in so doing to allow us to attain our purpose as human beings who are created in the image of God and who exist, with our own creative potential, for the glory of God.

Management’s job is “not to prevent risk but to build the capability to recover when failures occur,” he says. Catmull goes on to note that the capacity for recovering from failure rests in talented people.

The challenge, Catmull says, “is getting talented people to work effectively with one another. That takes trust and respect, which we as managers can’t mandate; they must be earned over time. What we can do is construct an environment that nurtures trusting and respectful relationships and unleashes everyone’s creativity. If we get that right, the result is a vibrant community where talented people are loyal to one another and their collective work, everyone feels that they are part of something extraordinary, and their passion and accomplishments make the community a magnet for talented people coming out of schools or working at other places.”


# Dave Odom: Habits are key to transformative leadership

his principle is what made Jethro’s advice in Exodus 18 so timely. Moses was willing to listen and risk engaging in new activities because he recognized that fundamentally his leadership was focused on God, not on himself. Moses -- and other leaders facing new circumstances or changed contexts -- can change their mindsets only if they engage in new activities that help them develop new habits.

Consider, for example, a budding social entrepreneur who was her high school and college valedictorian and has a mindset shaped by continuous success. One of the lessons of starting a new organization is having a mindset of experimentation and “survivable failure.” This social entrepreneur will need to engage in activities that enable her to cultivate habits so she learns a new mindset that is otherwise unfamiliar and, initially at least, likely to be destabilizing.

While a leader with a “crisis” mindset would be inclined to cut the budget and wait for better times, a leader willing to learn a new pattern of thinking might engage in new activities -- remembering the organization’s past, inquiring about current needs, strategizing about the organization’s contribution, experimenting with new services -- leading to new habits and a new mindset of “seeing opportunity.”

As James Dubik, the U.S. Army general who directed the transformation of the Army in the 2000s, once told me, “Change is very practical: ‘What do you want me to do differently?’” A vision has to be translated into a set of activities that become habits.

Ultimately, we are all about joining with God’s transformative work in the world. God has given a clear vision of his reign. It is for us to translate that vision into the activities, mindsets and traits needed where we live.
