The church of the future in a few words?

Inclusive. Active. Innovative. Interactive. Authentic. Out in the community. Responsive.


“Theology by its nature is a communal and social enterprise, and so we’re heading into a ‘Wiki-theology’ where others are allowed to critique, enhance, and even challenge traditional theology. And ultimately, that’s early church, where folks got their latest circular from this guy, Paul, and sat together in a house to read it and talk together about what it meant. We are being led back there. . . .

We have to stop asking Millennials to come to us, on our terms, and be like us. The church in the twenty-first century is an apostolic age, whereas the twentieth century was a discipleship age where “You come to us, and we’ll teach you how to follow Jesus.” But now, we must go out and abide.”
— Rodger Nishioka, Associate Professor of Christian Education at Columbia Theological

“Many Millennials consider the church a place that tells you what you can or cannot do — not a place where they can affect change. No matter its form, my hope for the future is that the church remains a place where you can go to be rejuvenated and restored, where you can be a part of a community that embraces and loves you.  In order to do that, we must negotiate and balance the role of the church with tradition AND innovation, not either/or.”
— Minister Natasha Patterson, Chaplain Resident at Emory University Hospital
