# ibike.org: [Organizing A Bicycle Clubs](http://www.ibike.org/encouragement/club.htm)

> Bicycle clubs take many forms; some focus on organizing rides, some spotlight advocacy and other may be skewed to safety education. Also, it is not unusual for a club to start with one mission and over time see that shift a little or broaden out as the club matures. The vocabulary can be location specific as well; for some the motivation is health, or environment, or personal economics, or national economics or social opportunity, etc.  There are so many ways and reason to be involved in bicycling that every club is a little different.

> Using a ride organizing club as an example, the bicycle clubs provide members information on new places to ride, a body of like-minded people to ride with, a source of answers to cycling (and life) questions and a united front to help promote bicycling.

> There are no rules or magic wand for starting a bike club.  Forming a club is often an effort in community organizing, and community organizing is a effort in educating / marketing (i.e. "join the club to ride more often," "join the club for comradery," "join the club to see new places," "join the club to learn how to ride better," "join the club to share your knowledge and experience with others," etc.)

> Ask yourself: What is the local "bicycle need"?  How can you tap into it and help fill it.  Probably no two bike clubs started the same way or have the same structure. You should feel comfortable using a structure that works best for you and your community.

> If you are starting a bicycle club for youths it is often best to incorporate some none-bicycle activities into the pitch and programs (i.e. "cycle for pizza," "cycle for ice cream," "cycle to a bakery" -- but they don't have to be food oriented, for example "cycle to the movies," "cycle to the fun center," or "cycle to a special park".)  Depending upon the skill level and safety awareness of the group you might have to work up to the most desirable destinations and infuse some safety messages into activities.  Adult leading youth programs have special liability concerns.  Because of this it is important that care be taken that participants demonstrate proficiency and safety know appropriate for the ride that they will be participating on, and have a liability waive signed by their parent or guardian.

> Bicycle clubs usually develop out of a series of activities; recreation rides, training rides and races, bicyclists' rights campaign, workshops/clinics (repairs, commuting, touring, racing, hot weather, cold weather, riding with children, etc). You can be a catalyst to the process by contacting interested people, distributing leaflets (usually where there are concentrations of cyclists) and posting notices (physical and cyber) to let people know what is happening.

> In the process contact your local bike shop. They will often support a club by offering discounts to members on equipment and/or providing a meeting place. In exchange, the bike shop should be acknowledged in the newsletter and other appropriate club products and publications. Another source of support and ideas are national, regional or other large bike clubs in your area. It also may be advantageous to affiliate with one of these larger bodies, for example to get insurance. Racing clubs may be required to affiliate with a regulatory body.

> If your first activity for forming your club is arranging a meeting, make sure it has a clearly stated goal, such as to form a club, to determine interest, to set a ride schedule or organize around a specific issue. If your first action is a ride or event then the goal is usually pretty clearly implied.

> If you want a club based on recreational group rides, you might start by posting signs, making phone calls and sending email messages, that there will be a ride starting from some location, at a given time, every week on say Saturday. As these rides grow in popularity you can add a second series of rides on another day of the week. If the group of interested people is large enough you might have different rides with different levels of difficulty.

> Once the club is established, don’t sit back and merely let events take their course. An active club is forever looking for new ideas, a regular influx of new members, a continual program. Keep recruiting, have a regular newsletter, establish a visual identity, keep in touch with local politicians and community service groups, produce a leaflet to be displayed at bike shops, make sure the bike shops are restocked with your leaflet, develop new club leadership, etc.

> Bike clubs often arrange benefits for their members: loaner bicycle trainers and bicycle travel cases, discounts on club events, discounts at bike shops, and/or discounts for related services (i.e. memberships at gyms, the Y, car-sharing programs, Better World Club, etc.)

> All this is a lot of work, but an energetic club with lots of volunteers can accomplish a great deal. The success of a club depends largely on the amount of effort put in by the members!

## Can nonprofits make a profit?

> Nonprofit organizations can take in more money than they spend each year as long as that is not their primary purpose, the profits don’t go to insiders, and the amount of profit is not significant. Nonprofits can build a financial cushion to pay future expenses or start a multi-year fund for a nonprofit purpose (such as buying equipment when the organization raises enough money). If the IRS sees that you are making a large profit each year and not spending it on your mission, it might audit you and could ultimately take away your tax-exempt status.

## Obtaining Funding - Corporate Sponsors, Grants, Donations

> [Y]ou might think you want to be a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization so sponsors can write off their fees. This is not necessary. Sponsorships are regular business expenses, so sponsors don’t need (and can’t get) charitable-donation tax deductions.

> If you want to apply for a specific grant (or ongoing grants), you might need tax-exempt status. Many national sports organizations provide funding for grass roots youth sports associations. The U.S. Tennis Association provides millions of dollars each year to local community tennis associations for facilities improvements and programs, but these organizations must be 501(c)(3) organizations to receive the funds.

> If your league or tournament won’t be soliciting donations, you might not need tax-exempt status

> If you will be providing instruction and/or other types of education as part of your mission, want to qualify for grants, and want donors to get a tax deduction for contributions, you should apply for 501(c)(3) status.

> Legal non-profit status requires paperwork with both the State and Federal government. The principal benefit is protection from State and Federal income taxes and some State sales taxes. A general benefit from nonprofit status is a limitation on liability to members in case of an accident. There are different non-profit classes to consider.

> The second issue is independence versus dependence. There are valid reasons for either choice. Independence gives the club complete freedom of choice in activities and finances. It also requires club members to do the things needed to continue as a viable club; such as securing liability insurance, budgets, and legal filing requirements. Affiliation (partial dependence) with another group can provide many of these features, such as group insurance, legal requirements, ready access to a newsletter and access to others with similar interests to work on desired activities. Existing organizations to consider are:
>
> • 4-H Programs (Cooperative Extension Service)
> • Churches
> • Schools
> • YMCA, YWCA and other recreation groups
> • Fitness and running clubs
> • Boy and Girl Scouts
> • City and County Recreation Departments

## Liability For clubs

> You may want to purchase separate and more complete coverage for certain special events that you are planning.

> On the other hand if you are an independent group, whether incorporated or not, you should locate a competent insurance sales representative by consulting other groups in your area with similar legal structure, i.e. social club, 501 (c) 3 non profit, unincorporated club, etc. In this world of litigation, it's best that you have some idea of your legal liability in the event that anyone is hurt at an event staged by your club. The representative that you consult with should be given all the facts on just what your group is and plans to do. It will then be up to them to design a package of insurance for your needs. You will then be able to pick and choose among the options and come up with what you feel to be adequate coverage. Don't forget to get more than one estimate of coverage. Insurance like any other saleable item is open to a wide range of prices. Shop around!

## Officers and their responsibilities

## Activities

> A. Organized Club Rides
> Generally the first thing any club does is start out with group rides. When the club is formed the natural progression is to continue a weekly schedule of club rides. As the club gets larger it is best to have rides that cater to different rider abilities.
>
> B. One Day Rides
>
> Many clubs run "one day" invitational rides to raise money for club activities. For more information on organizing a one day ride visit our Guide to Organizing a Bicycle Event.
>
> C. Advocacy Efforts
>
> As bicyclist we need to continue to be vigilant in protecting our safety and rights to use the roadways. Each club should have an Advocacy Component as one of its activities. This could be as simple as someone monitoring city and county government to make sure bicyclists rights are not in jeopardy of being taken away. Strong advocacy programs have club members represented as stakeholders on key government committees. Check out the Advocacy Tool Kit for more information on bicycle advocacy.
>
> D. Education Efforts
>
> Education and advocacy go hand in hand. It is hard to do one without the other. At the very least a club should offer to conduct bicycle safety presentations at the local school and run a bike rodeo once a year. For more education ideas you can explore the rest of the Toolkit that this document is part of.
>
> E. Volunteerism
Too often a few people do all the work in a club. It is important to start from the beginning of developing a club culture that nurtures volunteerism. All volunteer jobs should have a clear job description so that members know what is expected. The key to recruiting volunteers is to ask. Unless you ask you will never know. Once you have volunteers, you can never say thank you enough.

> Many beginning clubs have no insurance policy at all. While this may be a policy of begging for disaster, it is an option that many small clubs will follow. They feel that since they are very small, and do not have very much money, that no one would care to sue them. What often is not recognized is the fact that in the case of an unincorporated club the officers, and possibly the members, can be brought into a liability suit. In the case of a judgment against the club, each officer or member can be held financially liable. If the club is incorporated, the corporate structure includes a "corporate veil" that can protect the officers and members from some lawsuits. Penetration of the "corporate veil" is possible in cases of gross negligence, but is not common. Therefore, if your club is going to take the risk of staging events without any insurance, it had better examine the protection that incorporation can bring.

# sportsfacilityexpert.com: [Should You Open Your Sports Academy as a For-Profit or a Non-Profit Organization?](http://www.sportsfacilityexpert.com/2016/01/07/should-you-open-a-nonprofit-sports-academy/)

> In my experience, the sports organizations that benefit the most from nonprofit status are those whose primary services are teams, such as a rec soccer leagues or volleyball clubs. These types of organizations often rely heavily on sponsorships to keep fees manageable for their players and families, and sponsorships for nonprofit teams tend to be generally attractive to local businesses.

The following quote from sportsfacilitiyexpert.com conflicts with the statement above from youthletic:

> Remember, a for-profit sports academy or sports complex can also collect money from sponsorships, but they won’t be tax-exempt for donors, so you have to make them especially compelling in other ways.

> If sponsorships feature heavily as an income source in your business plan, you should consult with your accountant about filing for nonprofit status.

> Member income funds social clubs. This can be in the form of membership fees, dues, or assessments.
>
> However, 501(c)(7) organization may receive up to 35 percent of its gross receipts, including investment income, from sources outside of its membership without losing its tax-exempt status. No more than 15 percent of the amount may be derived from use of the club’s facilities or services by the general public or from other activities not furthering social or recreational purposes for members.
>
> If an organization has nonmember income exceeding these limits, all the facts and circumstances will be considered in determining whether the club continues to qualify for exemption .

> **Can a social club limit its membership to a specific religion?**
>
> Yes, a club may, in good faith, limit its membership to members of a particular religion in order to further the teachings or principles of that religion. It may not exclude individuals of a particular race or color.

> **Why choose to apply for exemption under 501(c)(7) instead of 501(c)(3)?**
>
> Applying for exemption under 501(c)(7) as a social club allows a group to pool their money in pursuit of an exempt purpose without being subject to an additional tax. This can be helpful when a group of individuals wants to build a recreational facility like a swimming pool or tennis court.  Individuals who become members can contribute to purchase of the facility and utilize it according to the club’s rules.
>
> 501(c)(3) organizations must spend their income on activities that further their exempt purpose, which is a charitable cause. 501(c)(7) social clubs’ exempt purpose does not have to be charitable, but it must be social or recreational and non-profitable.
>
> Designation as a 501(c)(7) also allows the group to limit membership. Instead of operating like a business for the public, social clubs only serve members.
>
> If a group forms a social club and allows nonmembers to utilize its facilities, services, and/or programs, then the club must keep careful records of nonmembers’ use. Social clubs must also ensure that nonmember income does not exceed the limits established by the IRS.
