# Recognition of Tax-Exempt Status
**Automatic Exemption for Churches**
Churches that meet the requirements of IRC Section 501(c)(3) are automatically
considered tax exempt and are not required to apply for and obtain recognition of
tax-exempt status from the IRS.
Although there is no requirement to do so, many churches seek recognition of
tax-exempt status from the IRS because this recognition assures church leaders,
members and contributors that the church is recognized as exempt and qualifies
for related tax benefits. For example, contributors to a church that has been
recognized as tax exempt would know that their contributions generally are
tax-deductible.

[Churches, Integrated Auxiliaries, and Conventions or Associations of Churches](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/churches-integrated-auxiliaries-and-conventions-or-associations-of-churches):

> Churches (including integrated auxiliaries and conventions or associations of churches) that meet the requirements of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code are automatically considered tax exempt and are not required to apply for and obtain recognition of exempt status from the IRS. Donors are allowed to claim a charitable deduction for donations to a church that meets the section 501(c)(3) requirements even though the church has neither sought nor received IRS recognition that it is tax exempt. In addition, because churches and certain other religious organizations are not required to file an annual return or notice with the IRS, they are not subject to automatic revocation of exemption for failure to file. See [Annual Return Filing Exceptions](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/annual-exempt-organization-return-who-must-file) for a complete list of organizations that are not required to file.

> Nevertheless, many churches do seek IRS recognition of tax-exempt status because that recognition provides reliance to church leaders, members and contributors that a church is recognized as exempt from taxation and is eligible to receive tax-deductible contributions. (For more information, see [Publication 1828](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1828.pdf), Tax Guide for Churches and Religious Organizations.)

> Many churches DO seek recognition of tax-exemption from the IRS. One reason is that without the IRS's official recognition of tax exemption ... the burden of proof of tax deductible contributions is on your donors if ever audited.
>
> Note: Although most churches are exempt from filing and paying federal income taxes, they may not be exempt from state taxes. Contact your state's tax agency to see what taxes your church is exempt from paying.

> Also...church are NOT exempt from payroll taxes!!!

startchurch.com: [3 Myths of the 501(c)(3) ](https://www.startchurch.com/blog/view/name/3-myths-of-the-501c3)

> Misconception #3: “Obtaining 501(c)(3) approval is not required.”
>
> With just a small amount of searching online, you will find many groups teaching that applying for 501(c)(3) is not necessary for churches because of section 508(c)(1)(a). These groups have the mistaken and misinformed notion that by simply not applying for 501(c)(3) status, the church entity is not required to meet any of the requirements of section 501 and the IRS cannot revoke its exempt status. However, this is simply not true.
>
> Now yes, section 508(c)(1)(a) provides that churches do not have to apply for 501(c)(3) status. However, in a case heard before the United States Tax Court (Jack Lane Taylor v. Commissioner), the court ruled that “Section 508(c)(1) simply relieves churches from applying for a favorable determination letter regarding their exempt status as required by section 508(a).” Nothing in section 508(c)(1) relieves a church from having to meet the requirements of section 501(c)(3).

> In my firm and honest opinion, I believe that applying for 501(c)(3) status is the best First Amendment defense available to your church. When you apply for 501(c)(3) status, your organizational and governing documents (articles of incorporation, constitution & bylaws, written doctrines, etc.) all become a part of your public record.

> We can look to the court case Bernstein v. Ocean Grove. Ocean Grove, a Methodist retreat center in New Jersey, was ruled to allow a same-sex marriage take place at its retreat center because it was incorporated as a secular organization (rather than religious), and did not have any written doctrines. The case may have gone much differently had Ocean Grove properly established itself as a religious entity in its governing documents. Therefore, when you apply for 501(c)(3) status and have sound religious language in your organizational and governing documents, all of that will be included in your public record, giving your First Amendment rights a strong defense.
