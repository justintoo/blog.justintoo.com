Millennials don't want to work for you, they want to work with you

Linda Hill, a Harvard professor and co-author of the book Collective Genius, said in a recent TED Talk, "Talented people don't want to follow me anywhere. They want to co-create, with me, the future."

Leadership Network's Eric Swanson said millennials don't want a "guided discussion" where the conclusions are already predetermined, and since they don't subscribe to the concept of lifetime employment with a company they want to be able to contribute from day one, which is a very positive thing when developing a leadership pipeline, he explained.

Here are a few stats about millennials that dispel some negative stereotypes:

    63 percent donate to charity
    43 percent actively volunteer
    70 percent of millennials said their career is central to their identity
    54 percent want to start their own business or already have done so
    Millennials comprise one-third of all entrepreneurs in the U.S.
    64 percent said they would rather make $40K a year at a job they love than $100K
    a year at a job they think is boring.
    50 percent would rather have no job than one that they hate

Based on Discovery No. 3, millennials will actually cause churches and pastors to be more authentic, participatory, externally focused, inclusive and more diverse

Swanson asserted that the church has more to learn about authenticity, inclusion, entrepreneurship, diversity,
and living on purpose than it has to teach. He added that the Church should not presume that as millennials age they will simply assume the roles of the Boomer and Gen X worlds.
