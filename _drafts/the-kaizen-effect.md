Anyone who has consistently thrown loose change in a jar has experienced the power of the "kaizen" effect. Kaizen is a Japanese concept enjoying use in the United States by companies looking to improve operations and the bottom line. Its power rests in the cumulative effect of small-scale but consistent progress and can be summed up by the phrase "continual improvement."

# General Applicability

In Japan, kaizen isn't only a business strategy, it's evident throughout Japanese culture, serving as an approach to life. The same holistic approach is found when kaizen migrates to the workplace, where the goal of continual improvement is applied everywhere -- to processes, people and products alike. In companies practicing kaizen, betterment is supported through growth, learning and training. Employees, who are in the best position to know what does and doesn't work in their respective jobs, suggest improvements and solve problems. When adopted, changes are publicized to reinforce the company's commitment to kaizen.

# Involvement

To fulfill a commitment to kaizen, everyone throughout the company must be a part of it. Without total involvement, the kaizen effect will be reduced or even fail to materialize.

taking a bottom-up approach, with the workers themselves empowered to improve their own processes, works best.

# Different Approaches
In the United States, a kaizen method called "kaizen blitz" or "kaizen event" doesn't employ small improvements across a company to create an effect, but instead brings a team together for a short-term project to improve a process. These projects typically take up to 10 days.

# The Kaizen Effect

That's why it's not only important to first sow your seeds of success but to also continually nourish them; any journey towards success is a life-long commitment.
