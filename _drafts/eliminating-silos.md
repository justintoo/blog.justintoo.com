# [What's Emerging in the Future of the Church?]({% post_url 2016-12-15-whats-emerging-in-the-future-of-the-church %})

I'm looking for a framework to help me think about how we can unify the work of the Church in a landscape filled with inescapable diversity - be it cultural, traditional, denominational, generational, or theological.

# The Lost Practice of Cooperation

As Jim Richards said, "Cooperation is almost a lost practice... [But] there are no Lone Ranger Christians or churches. Whether you call it networking or teamwork, we are stronger together."

The future of the church must be an ecosystem rooted in working partnerships and amicable fellowships.

It's far too common and convenient for you and I to sit under the shade of our own church tree, sipping spiritual koolaid, unwilling to cross the heated divide separating our congregation from the congregation down the street from us.

In spirit we are so united, yet in the flesh we are so divided.

We allow the power of the Gospel to miraculously heal us, restore us, strengthen us, and fill us with joy, passion, mission, purpose, and eternal hope. Yet we do not allow the Gospel to bind us together as One Church under God. Why is this?

# Three Measures to Eliminating Silos, Empowering Collaboration

I think examining the classic problem of silos within organizations and amongst organizations will be a starting point to solving the puzzle. The symptoms of organizational silos are apparent within churches and the worldwide Church, including lack of coordination, synchronization, and integration, and lack of awareness of other priorities within the wider organization.

I just googled "overcoming silos in business" and "overcoming silos in churches", and also brainstormed for myself some reasons why I think collaboration is not happening:

1. Lack of coordination
2. Lack of synchronization
3. Lack of integration
4. Tunnel Vision
5. Divergence without convergence

Staff and members are broken down into working groups, but there are never any points of integration.

The insulated decision making within churches coupled with separate budgets and responsibilities leads to a lack of awareness of other priorities within the wider organization.

All in all, this is the classic problem of silos within an organization.

The silo mentality is an organizational way of thinking. It happens when groups don't share information, goals, tools, priorities and processes with other groups.

Communication and collaboration are essential to breaking down the silo mentality

Here are three measures from a business article on huddle.com written by Bryan Vanetten, titled "[Avoiding operational silos](https://www.huddle.com/blog/breaking-operational-silos/)":

1. **Active measures** through company policies. The policies for running the company and its processes needs to be clear and a sense of ownership must be felt by all within the organization.

2. **Passive measures**, such as allowing employees of various departments the ability to connect over work and non-work related events.

3. **Formal Measures** providing some upper-management structure. One of the most important structures to put into place is a formal communication platform.


# Four Levels of Christian Cooperation

 In [Four Levels of Christian Cooperation](http://theologicalmatters.com/2014/06/03/four-levels-of-christian-cooperation/) by Jim Richards on [TheologicalMatters.com](http://theologicalmatters.com/), Jim presents four levels of cooperation among Christians and churches from his experience:

1. **Individual Cooperation** between believers using a common foundation, e.g. agreement on salvation.
2. **Congregational Cooperation** within a single church using a set of shared beliefs and behaviors amongst its members.
3. **Ecclesiastical Cooperation** between churches using a formal statement of faith (a "confessional statement") to bind them together.
4. **Moral Cooperation** between churches, individual believers, and the wider community using points of cultural engagement.



# Love in Action

> Jesus said the litmus test for a believer is love. He said people will know we are his followers by the way we love one another (John 13:35). Love is an action verb.
>
> One of the ways we show our love is when we work together for the gospelâ€”when we cooperate.
>
>There is no greater cause for which to cooperate than the advancement of the gospel.
