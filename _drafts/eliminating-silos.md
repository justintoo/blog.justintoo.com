# [What's Emerging in the Future of the Church?]({% post_url 2016-12-15-whats-emerging-in-the-future-of-the-church %})

HBR: [The New Boundaries of the “Boundaryless” Company](https://hbr.org/1992/05/the-new-boundaries-of-the-boundaryless-company&ab=Article-Links-End_of_Page_Recirculation) by Larry Hirschhorn and Thomas Gilmore.

remove barriers among traditional functions, “recognize no distinctions” between domestic and foreign operations, and “ignore or erase group labels such as ‘management,’ ‘salaried,’ or ‘hourly,’ which get in the way of people working together.”

a new set of boundaries becomes important.

These new boundaries are more psychological than organizational. They aren’t drawn on a company’s organizational chart but in the minds of its managers and employees. And instead of being reflected in a company’s structure, they must be “enacted” over and over again in a manager’s relationships with bosses, subordinates, and peers.

Paradoxically, being an effective follower often means that subordinates have to challenge their superiors. After all, allowing superiors to act foolishly only undermines them.

What it takes to be an effective superior is similarly complicated. Managers need to take charge and to provide strong leadership. But in the process, they must also remain open, even vulnerable, to criticism and feedback from below. If subordinates need to challenge in order to follow, superiors must listen in order to lead. 

HBR: [Jack Welch’s Approach to Breaking Down Silos Still Works](https://hbr.org/2015/09/jack-welchs-approach-to-breaking-down-silos-still-works) by Ron Ashkenas

He advocated for a “boundaryless organization,” and to build it, he initiated what became known as the GE Work-Out process – a series of structured and facilitated forums, bringing people together across levels, functions, and geographies to solve problems and make decisions in real time.

many organizations still have hierarchical, siloed, and fragmented processes and cultures. In fact, having to cope with a fast-changing global economy has led many companies to create even more complex matrix organizations

keep everyone focused on the cost and delivery goals, and get people to reach consensus.

HBR: [Eight Ways to Build Collaborative Teams](https://hbr.org/2007/11/eight-ways-to-build-collaborative-teams&ab=Article-Links-End_of_Page_Recirculation) by Lynda Gratton

Teams do well when executives invest in supporting social relationships, demonstrate collaborative behavior themselves, and create what we call a “gift culture”—one in which employees experience interactions with leaders and colleagues as something valuable and generously offered, a gift.

A third important role for executives is to ensure that mentoring and coaching become embedded in their own routine behavior—and throughout the company. We looked at both formal mentoring processes, with clear roles and responsibilities, and less formal processes, where mentoring was integrated into everyday activities. It turned out that while both types were important, the latter was more likely to increase collaborative behavior. Daily coaching helps establish a cooperative “gift culture” in place of a more transactional “tit-for-tat culture.”

Assigning leaders who are both task- and relationship-oriented.

Understanding role clarity and task ambiguity.

Our research shows that the opposite is true: Collaboration improves when the roles of individual team members are clearly defined and well understood—when individuals feel that they can do a significant portion of their work independently. Without such clarity, team members are likely to waste too much energy negotiating roles or protecting turf, rather than focus on the task. In addition, team members are more likely to want to collaborate if the path to achieving the team’s goal is left somewhat ambiguous. If a team perceives the task as one that requires creativity, where the approach is not yet well known or predefined, its members are more likely to invest time and energy in collaboration.





I'm looking for a framework to help me think about how we can unify the work of the Church in a landscape filled with inescapable diversity - be it cultural, traditional, denominational, generational, or theological.

# The Lost Practice of Cooperation

As Jim Richards said, "Cooperation is almost a lost practice... [But] there are no Lone Ranger Christians or churches. Whether you call it networking or teamwork, we are stronger together."

The future of the church must be an ecosystem rooted in working partnerships and amicable fellowships.

It's far too common and convenient for you and I to sit under the shade of our own church tree, sipping spiritual koolaid, unwilling to cross the heated divide separating our congregation from the congregation down the street from us.

In spirit we are so united, yet in the flesh we are so divided.

We allow the power of the Gospel to miraculously heal us, restore us, strengthen us, and fill us with joy, passion, mission, purpose, and eternal hope. Yet we do not allow the Gospel to bind us together as One Church under God. Why is this?

# Three Measures to Eliminating Silos, Empowering Collaboration

I think examining the classic problem of silos within organizations and amongst organizations will be a starting point to solving the puzzle. The symptoms of organizational silos are apparent within churches and the worldwide Church, including lack of coordination, synchronization, and integration, and lack of awareness of other priorities within the wider organization.

I just googled "overcoming silos in business" and "overcoming silos in churches", and also brainstormed for myself some reasons why I think collaboration is not happening:

1. Lack of coordination
2. Lack of synchronization
3. Lack of integration
4. Tunnel Vision
5. Divergence without convergence

Staff and members are broken down into working groups, but there are never any points of integration.

The insulated decision making within churches coupled with separate budgets and responsibilities leads to a lack of awareness of other priorities within the wider organization.

All in all, this is the classic problem of silos within an organization.

The silo mentality is an organizational way of thinking. It happens when groups don't share information, goals, tools, priorities and processes with other groups.

Communication and collaboration are essential to breaking down the silo mentality

Here are three measures from a business article on huddle.com written by Bryan Vanetten, titled "[Avoiding operational silos](https://www.huddle.com/blog/breaking-operational-silos/)":

1. **Active measures** through company policies. The policies for running the company and its processes needs to be clear and a sense of ownership must be felt by all within the organization.

2. **Passive measures**, such as allowing employees of various departments the ability to connect over work and non-work related events.

3. **Formal Measures** providing some upper-management structure. One of the most important structures to put into place is a formal communication platform.


# Four Levels of Christian Cooperation

 In [Four Levels of Christian Cooperation](http://theologicalmatters.com/2014/06/03/four-levels-of-christian-cooperation/) by Jim Richards on [TheologicalMatters.com](http://theologicalmatters.com/), Jim presents four levels of cooperation among Christians and churches from his experience:

1. **Individual Cooperation** between believers using a common foundation, e.g. agreement on salvation.
2. **Congregational Cooperation** within a single church using a set of shared beliefs and behaviors amongst its members.
3. **Ecclesiastical Cooperation** between churches using a formal statement of faith (a "confessional statement") to bind them together.
4. **Moral Cooperation** between churches, individual believers, and the wider community using points of cultural engagement.



# Love in Action

> Jesus said the litmus test for a believer is love. He said people will know we are his followers by the way we love one another (John 13:35). Love is an action verb.
>
> One of the ways we show our love is when we work together for the gospel—when we cooperate.
>
>There is no greater cause for which to cooperate than the advancement of the gospel.
