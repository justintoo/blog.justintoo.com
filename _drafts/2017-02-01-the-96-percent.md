# Titles

# What does the title mean?
Only 4% of the Bay Area is churched and we need to lift that number, and a new way to do that is simply with old methods - tapping into God's individual people. The reason 96% of the Bay Area is unchurched is because 96% of the people and potential is untapped.

## Brainstorming

1. "Reaching the 96%: Uplifting Untapped People and Potential"
2. "Reaching the 96%: The Strategy of Equipping Untapped People and Potential"
3. "Reaching the 96%: The Strategic Lift of Untapped People and Potential"

# Chapters

1. Identifying the 96%: What really is the Church?
2. Focusing on people: What is our Unifying Strategy?


X. Empowering the Mission: What can we learn from Jesus?

## TODO

1. We should have individual chapters focused on how God tapped into individual bible characters, and then ultimately, how he tapped into the life and ministry of Jesus.
