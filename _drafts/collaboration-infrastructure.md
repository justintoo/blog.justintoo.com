# Creating a Collaboration Infrastructure
People have been talking about collaboration in the nonprofit sector for decades. I think the difference is creating the infrastructure.

Everybody’s busy with their own projects and their own priorities. Unless there’s an infrastructure that holds the collaboration together, it’s not possible for it to succeed or to survive.

But it doesn’t take a lot of money to support the infrastructure. Strive leverages a small amount of money to coordinate lots of people. The culture project has staff and a help desk to make sure the evaluation system works.

You need the infrastructure if you’re going to help organizations. I can imagine faith-based organizations in a city being able to provide an infrastructure. They can be a nucleus for these kinds of collaborations.
